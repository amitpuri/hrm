User studies reveal a range of usability chal-\nlenges around prompting [208], evaluating and relying on outputs\n[156], and deciding on an automation strategy: whether and how\nto integrate GenAI into workflows [14, 154].\nRecent work has sought to characterize the unique properties of\nGenAI and their potential effects on users [156, 157], and to offer\ntechnical or design roadmaps for designing human-centered GenAI\n[34, 197]. However, there is not yet a coherent understanding of the\nusability challenges of GenAI, much less one grounded in a theory\nof human cognition. Indeed, recent work has called for founda-\ntional research to understand how people interact with GenAI and\nAI more broadly [99, 104]. Here, we argue that metacognition—the\npsychological ability to monitor and control one’s own thought\nprocesses [4, 62, 131, 181]—offers a valuable and unexplored per-\nspective to understand and design for the usability challenges of\nGenAI.

Secondly, we suggest that the perspective of\nmetacognitive demands offers new research and design opportuni-\nties for human-AI interaction.\nThe metacognitive demands of working with GenAI systems\nparallel those of a manager delegating tasks to a team. A manager\nneeds to clearly understand and formulate their goals, break down\nthose goals into communicable tasks, confidently assess the quality\nof the team’s output, and adjust plans accordingly along the way.\nMoreover, they need to decide whether, when, and how to even del-\negate tasks in the first place. Among others, these responsabilities\ninvolve the metacognitive monitoring and control of one’s thought\nprocesses and behavior [4, 62, 128, 181].\nAnalogously, current GenAI systems often require verbalized\nprompting, demanding self-awareness of task goals, and decompo-\nsition of tasks into sub-tasks. System outputs then need to be eval-\nuated, requiring well-adjusted confidence in one’s evaluation and\nprompting abilities, and metacognitive flexibility to iterate on the\nprompting strategy as necessary. Alongside the local interactions\nwith GenAI systems, the generality of GenAI poses another, higher-\nlevel metacognitive demand: the challenge of knowing whether and\nhow to incorporate GenAI into workflows—i.e., one’s ‘automation\nstrategy’ (see also [154]). This demands self-awareness of GenAI’s\napplicability to, and impact on, one’s workflow; well-adjusted con-\nfidence in manual versus GenAI-supported task completion; and\nmetacognitive flexibility to adapt one’s workflows as needed. We\nposit that these metacognitive demands are induced by GenAI’s\nmodel flexibility, generality, and originality.1 In §3, we draw on\nmetacognition research and recent user studies of GenAI to illus-\ntrate these metacognitive demands and offer new research direc-\ntions to probe them further.\nThese demands can be addressed in at least two complementary\nways. Firstly, given that metacognitive abilities can be taught [45, 52,\n126], we canimprove users’ metacognition via metacognitive support\nstrategies that can be integrated into GenAI systems. Evidence-\nbased metacognitive support strategies include those that help\nusers in their planning, self-evaluation, and self-management [159].\nRecent HCI work has begun to pursue this direction [ 173, 204],\nalbeit without explicitly grounding it in metacognition; we suggest\nthat a metacognitive lens offers new research and design directions\nfor augmenting GenAI system usability.\nSecondly, we can reduce the metacognitive demand of GenAI\nsystems by designing task-appropriate approaches to GenAI ex-\nplainability and customizability. We suggest that explainability can\nhelp offload metacognitive processing from the user to the system,\n1Although the perspective of metacognition is equally relevant for understanding the\nusability of search engines and similar technologies, we focus our scope to GenAI\nsystems as they are relevantly distinct from that of search engines [157]. Firstly, they\nare more flexible in their responsiveness to user prompts, in the range of implicit and\nexplicit parameters available to users in their prompts, and in the multi-modality of\ntheir input/output space. Secondly, unlike search engines, they function as general-\npurpose tools, able to perform content generation, discrimination, and editing, among\nother functions (rather than merely retrieve existing content). Finally, unlike search\nengines, current GenAI systems are non-deterministic in their responses. As we aim to\ndemonstrate here, all of these features place unique demands on users’ metacognition\nand inform the design space of solutions to address these demands, a design space\nwhich necessarily extends beyond that of current search engines.

Relatedly, we also\nnote that Russell [50] proposed a connected idea of ‘meta-literacy’ for search engine\nusability (see also [112]); however, this work does not delve into the psychological and\ncognitive science of metacognition that is central to the current work.\nand that existing explainability approaches can be augmented by\nconsidering metacognition. Likewise, we suggest that a metacogni-\ntive perspective can provide insights on approaching the end-user\ncustomizability of GenAI systems. In §4, we draw on intervention\nstudies to improve metacognition and studies of GenAI prototypes\nand human-AI interaction to explore research and design directions\nthat can address the metacognitive demands of GenAI. Critically,\nwe also highlight how GenAI’s model flexibility, generality, and\noriginality can serve as a design solution to these demands. Finally,\nwe discuss the relationship between cognitive load and addressing\nmetacognitive demands, offering ways to manage their balance. In\nsummary, our work makes three distinct contributions:\n(1) We conceptualize and ground the usability challenges of\nGenAI in an understanding of human metacognition, draw-\ning on research from psychological and cognitive science\nand recent GenAI user studies.\n(2) We draw from research on metacognitive interventions,\nGenAI prototypes, and human-AI interaction to propose\ntwo directions for addressing the metacognitive demands of\nGenAI: improving users’ metacognition, and reducing the\nmetacognitive demands of GenAI.\n(3) We use the metacognition lens to identify the need—and con-\ncrete directions—for further research into the metacognitive\ndemands of GenAI, and design opportunities that leverage\nthe unique properties of GenAI to augment system usability.\nIn the next sections, we define metacognition, summarizing key re-\nsearch findings (§2); illustrate the metacognitive demands of GenAI,\nfocusing on prompting, evaluating and relying on outputs, and\ndeciding on one’s automation strategy (§3); and propose ways to\naddress these metacognitive demands (§4).\n2 WHAT IS METACOGNITION?\nMetacognition as a concept was first popularized by developmen-\ntal psychologist John H. Flavell in the late 1970s [64], as he tried\nto understand how children come to be aware of their own cog-\nnitive processes. Subsequently, Nelson and Narens [128] showed\nthat while adults are able to reflect on their thoughts, they often\nfail to be aware of the premises underlying their decision-making,\nand do not analyze, understand, and control their thought pro-\ncesses objectively. Their ‘metacognitive model’ first distinguished\nbetween object-level and meta-level cognition. Object-level pro-\ncesses reflect the basic cognitive work of perceiving, remembering,\nclassifying, deciding, and so on. Meta-level processes monitor those\nobject-level processes to assess their functioning (e.g., assessing\nhow well one grasped the gist of a text) and allocate resources\nappropriately (e.g., deciding to re-read the text). Since then, a grow-\ning line of research has linked improved metacognition to a range\nof benefits across different domains. Studies have shown that im-\nproved metacognition helps individuals with management of time,\nfocus, and effort [212], problem-solving [67], academic performance\n[45, 52, 106, 126, 180, 214], emotional well-being [200], and overall\ndecision-making [206].\nAs we argue in §3, alongside the promises of GenAI to trans-\nform work, it also poses usability challenges that can be fruitfully\nunderstood via metacognition. Nevertheless, the field of human-\ncomputer interaction (HCI) has so far considered metacognition"}

The\nrelative absence of metacognition research from many areas of HCI\nis surprising, considering that the early work on graphical user\ninterfaces was, as Alan Kay concluded, “solidly intertwined with\nlearning” [88]. One possible reason for this absence is the confusing\nplethora of existing and overlapping frameworks and theories on\nmetacognition. From education [106] to management [90], health-\ncare [36], and even sports [111], many research disciplines have\ncarved out their own approach to metacognition, producing mul-\ntiple inconsistent terminologies and frameworks (for reviews see\n[131, 181]).\nTo structure our analysis of the metacognitive demands of GenAI\nsystems, in §2.1-2.4 we present a simplified descriptive framework\nof metacognition, also summarized in Figure 1. In line with most\ncommon prior frameworks, we distinguish between metacognitive\nknowledge and experiences, two different sources of information for\nunderstanding one’s own cognition [55, 131, 181], and between the\nmetacognitive abilities of monitoring and control, through which\none can assess and guide their own cognition [4, 62, 129].\n2.1 Metacognitive knowledge and experiences\nMetacognitive knowledge, being explicit, includes people’s conscious\nunderstanding of aspects like their strategies (e.g., memory strate-\ngies [128]), reasoning abilities, decision-making, and beliefs [170].\nMetacognitive experiences include anything that people can di-\nrectly experience, and can be implicit, occurring without our direct\nintention or awareness [55]. This includes subjective feelings, like\na feeling of familiarity, or the feeling that one has misunderstood a\npassage while reading, as well as other implicit cues that provide\ninformation about cognitive processing (e.g., ‘processing fluency’\ncues, such as the speed at which a memory is retrieved) [4, 131].\nMetacognitive knowledge and experiences are interrelated [64].\nMetacognitive experiences can contribute to metacognitive knowl-\nedge—e.g., when feelings of difficulty during problem-solving be-\ncome encoded as knowledge that one is poor at problem-solving.\nMetacognitive knowledge can also be retrieved during metacogni-\ntive experiences, for example, when one remembers that they are\npoor at problem-solving when experiencing a feeling of difficulty.\n2.2 Metacognitive abilities: monitoring and\ncontrol\nMonitoring abilities involve the assessment of one’s own thinking,\nwhereas control abilities are those that directly guide one’s own\nthinking. Our focus is on the monitoring and control abilities that\nare most relevant to concrete task-oriented metacognitive demands\nposed by GenAI (see [181] for a more in-depth taxonomy).\nRelevant monitoring abilities for working with GenAI include\nself-awareness and adjustment of confidence. Self-awareness is the\ncapacity to recognize one’s own thoughts, emotions, and actions, as\nwell as how these factors influence cognition [73, 212]. This includes\nhaving a clear awareness of one’s specific goals and intentions—for\nexample, “What am I trying to convey with this email?” . This ability is\nimportant for prompting GenAI and determining one’s automation\nstrategy (§3.1 and §3.3).\nConfidence is one’s self-assessment of one’s cognitive abilities\nand their application to tasks [206]—e.g., “How confident am I that\nI can write this email with the appropriate tone and level of detail?”\nA ‘well-adjusted’ confidence distinguishes objectively correct and\nincorrect performance, and accurately matches one’s abilities. 2\nConfidence and its adjustment are central to decision-making and\nreasoning, especially in many aspects of human-AI interaction\n[4, 171] (§3.1, §3.2, and §3.3).\nRelevant control abilities for working with GenAI include\nmetacognitive flexibility and task decomposition.

Metacognitive\nflexibility is the ability to adaptively shift cognitive strategies when\nencountering new information, when realizing that a current strat-\negy isn’t effective, or when the demands of the task change [32]—\ne.g., “I recognize that my formal tone in my emails does not match the\nmore conversational style of my new co-workers. I should therefore\nadjust my approach while still maintaining professionalism” . It is a\nhallmark of creative problem-solving [144] and has been deemed\nessential for organizing and integrating a rapidly changing body of\ninformation [120]. Metacognitive flexibility is especially important\nwhen prompting and evaluating the output of GenAI (§3.1 and §3.2)\nand determining one’s automation strategy (§3.3).\nTask decomposition involves breaking down a task into con-\ncrete, actionable sub-tasks or steps. For instance, before writing\nan email, one might set clear objectives for what specific points to\ncommunicate—e.g., “I want to clearly explain the status of the project\nand ask for feedback. ” Then, one might decide on a structure for the\nemail, laying out the most important aspects first. These abilities\nare especially important for prompting GenAI (Section 3.1). As the\nexample suggests, task decomposition is not solely metacognitive\nbecause it often involves object-level cognitive processes.\nMonitoring and control are interrelated [93, 95]. Monitoring (i.e.,\nassessing our performance) affects control (e.g., by influencing a\nchange in strategies). Control (e.g., changing strategies) can also\nprovide feedback which affects monitoring (e.g., by altering the\nassessment of our performance).\n2.3 Interrelationship between knowledge and\nexperiences, and monitoring and control\nMetacognitive knowledge and experiences interact with monitoring\nand, in turn, with control [181]. For example, adequate metacogni-\ntive knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of one’s strategies\ncan affect the adjustment of confidence in a solution to a prob-\nlem (i.e., metacognitive monitoring). Conversely, improving mon-\nitoring, such as by practicing self-awareness, can increase one’s\nawareness of metacognitive experiences and knowledge. Likewise,\nmetacognitive experiences can influence, and be influenced by, our\nmetacognitive monitoring and control. For example, after expe-\nriencing a sense of misunderstanding, we might unconsciously\nadjust our sense of confidence (monitoring), and be prompted to\nre-read a passage (control). Similarly, the impact of metacognitive\nexperiences might vary based on monitoring abilities.

Metacognitive knowledge is the explicit understanding of\none’s abilities, strategies, and beliefs. Metacognitive experiences include things that people can directly experience, such as a\nfeeling of familiarity or other implicit cues that provide information about cognitive processes. Metacognitive knowledge and\nexperiences are interrelated in that experiences can become encoded as knowledge, and knowledge can be retrieved during\nexperiences (§2.3). Both of these can influence (and be influenced by) metacognitive monitoring, which includes self-awareness,\nand confidence and its adjustment. Metacognitive monitoring, in turn, influences (and is influenced by) metacognitive control\nprocesses, such as metacognitive flexibility and task decomposition. Metacognitive control acts upon the (object-level) cognitive\nprocesses involved in a task. Arrows indicate directions of influence (§2.3).\nexperiences (thereby also making them less implicit) [212]. Thus,\nthere is a tight interrelationship between metacognitive knowledge\nand experiences, and monitoring and control.3\n2.4 Domain generality and specificity of\nmetacognition\nWhether metacognitive abilities, knowledge, and experiences are\ndomain-general (universally applicable across different areas of\nknowledge, skills, or problem-solving) or domain-specific (pertain\nto a particular area of expertise to which they are finely tuned, such\nas math) is a matter of active debate, although there is evidence\nfor both views [11, 44, 68, 118, 151]. What kind of metacognition a\nsituation demands is likely context-dependent [44, 55], a particu-\nlarly relevant consideration for GenAI given its generality across\ndomains [157].\n2.5 Heuristics and priming metacognition\nPeople often implicitly and unintentionally rely on heuristics to\nguide their metacognitive monitoring and control [3]. For example,\npeople guide their metacognitive control by implicitly relying on\nthe ease of information processing (‘processing fluency’). Informa-\ntion that is easily or fluently processed (e.g., in terms of reading)\ntriggers less further cognitive processing relative to information\nthat is more difficult to process [ 3]. Because processing fluency\n3Some metacognition theories view metacognitive knowledge and experiences not\nas separate from monitoring, but rather as instances of monitoring that can be either\nknowledge- or experience- based [4, 93, 128]. However, we distinguish between the two\nsets of concepts to emphasize the difference between theability to monitor and control\ncognition, and information about cognition arising from metacognitive knowledge\nand experiences—e.g., the difference between the ability to be self-aware about one’s\nmemory (monitoring) and the information conveyed by a feeling of familiarity (an\nexperience).\nis subjectively experienced rather than consciously known, and\nbecause these heuristics are often activated implicitly, their activa-\ntion represents a metacognitive experience [3, 187].4 Manipulating\nthe activation of these heuristics (e.g., via priming) can be used to\nimprove metacognitive control: increasing subjective processing\ndifficulty (e.g., by using a degraded font) stimulates more metacog-\nnitive control and thereby improves participants’ performance on\nreasoning tasks that benefit from a more analytic processing style\n[7]. In §3, we discuss how engaging these heuristics when interact-\ning with GenAI may influence users."}

Other domains,\nsuch as design [70], writing [132], and data science [74] are likely\nto be experiencing similar changes with GenAI. We suggest that a\ncore dimension underlying these changes is a greater demand on\nusers’ metacognition that is imposed when users have to (a) prompt\nGenAI systems, (b) evaluate and decide to rely on GenAI output,\nand (c) decide on one’s workflow automation strategy: whether they\nshould automate certain tasks with GenAI and how to automate\nthem most effectively (previously described as “critical integration”\n[154]; see also [149])."}

Not all GenAI\nsystems impose the same type and extent of metacognitive demands\ndue to differences in interface design and interaction modes; where\nrelevant, we point out the implications of this. Throughout, we\nmake concrete suggestions on future research to better understand\nthese demands (summarized in Table 2).\n3.1 Prompting generative AI systems\nEnd-user studies suggest that prompting is challenging, with non-\nexpert users making various errors and adopting ineffective strate-\ngies—a reflection of the demand on users’ metacognitive monitoring\nand control [33, 41, 43, 85, 103, 174, 205]. During prompt formula-\ntion, the open-endedness of many current prompting interfaces\nrequires users to have self-awareness of their specific task goals,\nand be able to decompose their tasks into smaller sub-tasks so as\nto verbalize these as effective prompts (Figure 2a). Next, iterative\noutput evaluation and adjustment (prompt iteration ) depends on\nusers’ confidence in their prompting ability, and metacognitive flex-\nibility to adapt their prompting strategy (Figure 2b). We posit that\nthese demands are exacerbated by GenAI’s non-determinism and\nmodel flexibility (not to be confused with metacognitive flexibility)\nin terms of (a) the wide range of explicit and implicit parameters\nthat users can adjust, and (b) systems’ ability to work with prompts\nat a wide range of abstraction [156, 157].6\n3.1.1 Prompt formulation: self-awareness and task decomposition.\nIn manual task completion, many implicit goals and intentions\nembedded within tasks can remain so without ever being verbal-\nized. For example, when writing an email to a senior colleague, one\nmight implicitly know to adopt a certain tone. Many GenAI sys-\ntems require specification that the email is to a senior colleague and\nneeds an appropriate tone. Moreover, it often requires that a task be\nbroken up into sub-tasks (“combine my content”, “condense into two\nparagraphs”, “update the tone” ). This demand for self-awareness and\ntask decomposition is exacerbated by a particular type of model\nflexibility in GenAI: today’s systems afford many parameters for\nend-users to adjust; these can be formal parameters like the model\ntemperature, or a range of unspecified parameters that can be ad-\njusted through text prompting (e.g., the tone, level of detail, or\nstructure of a piece of text). This model flexibility and control af-\nforded to users requires knowing what one wants to achieve and\n5For an in-depth theoretical discussion of metacognition (or the overlapping concept\nof self-regulated learning) and cognitive load, see [46, 160, 163, 189].\n6A popular workaround to the challenge of prompting is ‘prompt libraries’ with de-\ntailed, task-specific prompts (see [176] for an overview).

Recent user\nstudies of GenAI systems illustrate these demands.\nIn [208], non-expert participants used an LLM-based tool to im-\nprove a chatbot through prompting. One of the challenges they\nexperienced was a struggle getting started. 7 Zamfirescu-Pereira\net al. [208] interpret this as a design-stage barrier in end-user pro-\ngramming, reflecting some version of the implicit question, “I don’t\neven know what I want the computer to do” . The self-awareness\nand explicitness demanded by prompting is also observed in LLM-\nsupported writing. Dang et al . [41] define and compare diegetic\nprompting (instructions conveyed implicitly when users input text\nfor the system to modify) and non-diegetic prompting (explicit in-\nstructions to the system). The latter is experienced as far more\nchallenging by users as it “forces writers to shift from thinking about\ntheir narrative or argument to thinking about instructions to the\nsystem” [41]. Similar difficulty with non-diegetic prompting was\nobserved among novice programmers in AI-assisted coding [83],\nand manufacturing designers co-creating with GenAI, who strug-\ngled to “think through the design problem in advance” [70]. These\ndifficulties were exacerbated by the many parameters available to\nusers who grappled with understanding and using them effectively\n[70, 83, 204].\nThe difference between diegetic and non-diegetic prompting\npoints to the broader question around GenAI system interfaces and\ninteraction modes and what they imply for the user experience\nand for productivity. For example, whereas diegetic prompting is\neasier, it affords less control than the alternative, with preferences\ndiffering across users [41]. Moreover, user experience and produc-\ntivity may not always go hand in hand. For example, systems with\nnon-diegetic prompting (e.g., ChatGPT) may be more challenging\nand time-consuming, yet the explicitness they require may plausi-\nbly act as a forcing function that ultimately trains metacognitive\nself-awareness and task decomposition, leading to higher quality\noutput, assuming users persevere [155].8 Nevertheless, in §4.1 we\nsuggest that there are more effective and user-friendly ways of\nsupporting metacognition.\nApropos of training, a key difference between expert and non-\nexpert programmers—and by extension, expert and non-expert\nprompt writers—is an explicit approach to considering task require-\nments [208]. Expert programmers have advanced metacognitive\nmonitoring and control, in that they are able to identify their specific\ngoals and decompose them into concrete tasks [60]. One developer\nin [103] described their strategy with LLM-supported coding as,“be\nincredibly specific with the instructions and write them as precisely as\nI would for a stupid collaborator” . Likewise, users in [14] who decom-\nposed the programming task into “microtasks”—“well-understood\nand well-defined jobs ”—were able to work effectively with Copi-\nlot (see also [150, 188]). Beyond coding, manufacturing designers\nwho successfully learned to co-create with GenAI abstracted and\nexplained the problem to themselves [70].9\n7Support getting started is a key user request for GenAI explainability; see §4.2.1.\n8The potential discrepancy between user experience and productivity is reminiscent of\nthat found in education, where the cognitive effort of effective learning is experienced\nnegatively by students, leading to a divergence between perceptions of the learning\nexperience and objective learning outcomes.\n9As the above quotes suggest, task decomposition can often mean crafting a prompt\nas a set of discrete instructions that a system can interpret all at once, but it can also"}

Often embedded within\na workflow with manual tasks, users may first need to formulate a prompt, requiring metacognitive abilities including self-\nawareness of task goals and task decomposition (a). Systems that provide automated suggestions such as GitHub Copilot\nalleviate some of the demands associated with prompting. Depending on the output, iterating on the prompt may be necessary,\nwhich requires well-adjusted confidence in one’s prompting ability and metacognitive flexiblity to adapt prompting strategies\nas necessary (b). Likewise, evaluating the output requires well-adjusted confidence in one’s ability to judge its validity (c).\nBeyond the local interaction with a GenAI system, there is an overarching demand connected to understanding whether, when,\nand how to apply GenAI to one’s workflows—one’s ‘automation strategy’. This requires self-awareness of how GenAI applies\nto and affects one’s workflows, and well-adjusted confidence in the ability to complete tasks manually and with GenAI (d).\nFinally, it also requires metacognitive flexbility to adapt one’s workflows as necessary (e).\nWe note that, although self-awareness and task decomposition\nare often required to some extent when interacting with GenAI\nsystems, their pertinence increases as users concretize their usage\nintentions (e.g., achieving work or personal goals). For example,\nusers interacting with GenAI systems for non-specific entertain-\nment or exploration may worry less about their prompting strategy.\nAt the same time, systems that support users’ metacognition can\nhelp surface or clarify intentions originally hidden from users’ self-\nawareness, thereby influencing their initial goals or lack thereof\n(see §4.1.2 for details).

[156] term a ‘fuzzy abstraction match-\ning’ problem—it becomes difficult for users to discern a system’s\ncapabilities and to match one’s intent and prompting accordingly\n(see also [61, 85] for similar conclusions).\nParticipants in [208] struggled with this (see also [43, 85, 205]).\nThey were unable to choose the right prompting instructions,\nincorrectly expecting human capabilities; in some cases, under-\nestimating the system’s capabilities; and insisted on socially ap-\npropriate—rather than effective—ways of prompting. Zamfirescu-\nPereira et al. interpret these challenges as stemming from “over-\ngeneralization from limited experience” , and “a social lens that fil-\ntered participants’ prompts. . . through expectations originating in\nhuman-human interactions” . From a metacognitive perspective,\nover-generalization reflects poorly adjusted confidence; rather than\nmaintaining an appropriately low confidence (about their own\nprompting), and gathering more evidence, participants drew confi-\ndent conclusions based on limited evidence. Participants’ insistence\non a social lens may reflect a lack of self-awareness of their prompt-\ning approach, poorly adjusted confidence, and/or inflexibility in\ntheir strategies. To be clear, these challenges partly stem from a\nlack of feedback in the system about prompting effectiveness, leav-\ning users to grapple with the fuzzy abstraction matching problem\nwithout support (see also §4.2.1 on explainability). However, that\nparticipants in [208] “avoided effective prompt designs even after\ntheir interviewer encouraged their use and demonstrated their effec-\ntiveness” suggests that this is also partly a metacognitive failure to\nnotice and/or adjust their mental model of the system, signaling\nlow metacognitive flexibility (see also [70, 204]).\nFuture research should systematically investigate how differ-\nent aspects of GenAI systems—such as their non-determinism and\nmodel flexibility—impact users’ ability to adjust their confidence in\ntheir prompting ability, flexibly adapt their prompting strategy, and\nupdate their mental model of these systems. For example, this could\nexamine how the temperature setting of a model influences users’\nconfidence and its adjustment, or how different levels of abstraction\ninfluence novice users’ prompting strategies.\n3.2 Evaluating and relying on generative AI\noutputs\nEvaluating and relying on AI output requires users to maintain a\nwell-adjusted confidence in their own domain expertise and ability\nto evaluate output (i.e., self-confidence; Figure 2c).

In this context, this includes confi-\ndence with ‘good’ calibration, meaning the overall confidence of a\nuser in their output evaluation accurately matches objective perfor-\nmance; and with ‘good’ resolution, meaning the user’s confidence\ncan correctly discriminate a correct output.12 The generative nature\nof GenAI—its ‘originality’ [157]—means that many user workflows\nwill or have shifted from users generating content to evaluating it\n[149, 154], as already documented in programming [156] and man-\nufacturing design [70]. Thus, users must maintain a well-adjusted\nlevel of confidence in their own ability to evaluate this output\nand not blindly accept generated content. Moreover, GenAI poses\nunique challenges to confidence adjustment that we discuss below.\n3.2.1 AI output evaluation and reliance: confidence adjustment.Re-\ncent work has investigated the role of self-confidence in evaluating\nand relying on AI output, although with discriminative models,\nrather than GenAI. For example, in AI-assisted decision-making\nin chess, participants’ reliance on the AI was only significantly\npredicted by their self-confidence, and not by their confidence in\nthe AI [35]. This dovetails with He et al. [77] who find that poor\nperformers in a logical reasoning task tend to be overconfident—the\nDunning-Kruger effect—leading to under-reliance on AI (see [182]\nfor related findings). Lu and Yin [108] show that, in the absence of\nAI accuracy information, humans rely on their agreement with AI\nas a heuristic for their reliance on it, albeit only when they have a\nhigh self-confidence. Older human-automation interaction studies\ndemonstrated a similar role for user self-confidence in influencing\nreliance on automation [47, 102, 114].\nAnalogous research in GenAI that explicitly measures and ma-\nnipulates user self-confidence is missing, but user studies suggest\na similar key role for well-adjusted confidence in output evalua-\ntion and reliance.13 Programmers were reluctant to deeply review\nand repair AI-generated code, preferring instead to re-write the\nentire code themselves [188]. Similarly, manufacturing designers co-\ncreating with GenAI were uncertain about how to interpret outputs\nand whether users or the system were responsible for addressing\nerrors [70]. By contrast, programmers who were highly confident\nin their own ability actively questioned the AI code assistant when\nit produced confusing output [198].\nThe challenge of output evaluation is present even in interaction\nmodes without user prompting, such as in GitHub Copilot, which\nincludes automated suggestions. In fact, such interaction modes\nmay arguably make output evaluation more challenging due to the\nneed to infer the intent behind systems’ suggestions [74]. Novices\n11Confidence in the system’s abilities is touched upon in §4.2.1 on explainability. Note\nalso that self-confidence in output evaluation and confidence in the system’s ability\nare both distinct from users’ self-confidence in theirprompting ability, discussed above\nin §3.1. Prompting and output evaluation influence each other as users iterate on their\ntask.\n12The two aspects of confidence can be independent. Having a well-calibrated con-\nfidence does not necessarily imply high confidence resolution. One could be well-\ncalibrated on average (e.g., one’s overall level of confidence matches one’s overall level\nof accuracy) but still have poor resolution (i.e., one’s confidence level does not vary\nmuch between correct and incorrect answers)[66].\n13Related to output evaluation, confidence and metacognition have also been studied\nin the context of phishing detection [29]."}

Given the\nimportance of users’ self-confidence for evaluating and relying\non AI outputs, future research should measure and manipulate\nself-confidence during user-GenAI interactions across different\ninteraction modes.\nOutput evaluation is relevant for many systems, such as search\nengines, but several aspects of GenAI pose unique challenges, which\nwe discuss below: theextensiveness of GenAI’s novel content output,\nthe relative ease of novel content generation, GenAI’s multiple,\nnon-intuitive failure modes, and the challenge of obtainingobjective\nquality measures for adjusting confidence in some workflows.\nThe extensiveness of GenAI’s novel content output. Whereas\nprior research has focused on explicit AI advice or decisions, GenAI\ncan produce (often extensive) content, such as entire emails, presen-\ntations, or software. Evaluating these outputs for quality therefore\nbecomes far more important and effortful (in terms of cognitive\nload) compared to ‘auto-complete’ phrase suggestions or intelli-\ngent code completion [156, 157]. How this will affect users’ self-\nconfidence and AI reliance remains unclear, but metacognition\nresearch suggests that increased effort requirements may discour-\nage users from appropriate evaluation [ 4]. Ackerman [2] found\nthat people’s internal confidence threshold for solving reasoning\nproblems decreases as the required effort increases; that is, “when\nproblems took longer to solve, participants appeared to compromise on\ntheir confidence criterion, and were willing to provide solutions with\nless confidence”. Worryingly, this persists even when participants\nare given the option to give up and respond “I don’t know” [ 2].\nLikewise, end-user programmers have been reported to “eyeball”\nthe AI outputs of natural language queries, which some suggest\nmay deepen the existing over-confidence that such users have in\ntheir programs’ accuracy [156, 169].\nFuture research should examine how the effort of evaluating\nGenAI output (in terms of length or complexity) affects users’ self-\nconfidence in their output evaluation, the accuracy of their evalua-\ntion, and their ultimate reliance on GenAI.\nThe relative ease of novel content generation. The relative\nease with which GenAI can produce extensive output may also\naffect output evaluation and reliance via potentially misleading\ncues that people implicitly rely on to update their confidence and\nguide their subsequent metacognitive control [4]. One relevant type\nof cue—‘processing fluency’, “the subjective ease of with which a\ncognitive task is performed” [3, 201]—can influence people’s confi-\ndence in information accuracy. For example, answers to various\nproblems are judged as more correct simply if they are displayed\nfaster to participants after problem descriptions [185]. It can also\naffect people’s confidence in their memory: the ease with which a\nmemory is retrieved increases participants’ confidence in their later\nremembering, even though, objectively, easier retrieval was asso-\nciated with worse future memory performance [ 16].14 Critically,\nthis effect extends to technology use: faster online information\nsearch retrieval increases participants’ confidence in their subse-\nquent memory of that information, despite no apparent causal\n14The influences of processing fluency cues are examples of metacognitive experiences.\nrelation between the two aspects [172].

More importantly, changes in\nconfidence can affect people’s approach to evaluating GenAI out-\nput. By increasing people’s confidence, such cues can affect their\nmetacognitive control, leading people to decrease the effort they\ninvest into further deliberate processing, as measured by thinking\ntime and changes-of-mind [4, 183, 184]. Confidence similarly in-\nfluences reliance on external reminders and information-seeking\n[22, 49] (see also §3.3.2).\nFuture research should systematically investigate how aspects\nof GenAI output (e.g., the speed at which it’s produced, or its verbal\nfluency, in the case of text) can serve as cues that influence users’\nconfidence in the output and their ability to evaluate it, as well as\nthe effort they ultimately invest into evaluation.\nMultiple, non-intuitive failure modes of GenAI . Users’ con-\nfidence and their ability to adjust it may also be challenged by the\nfact that GenAI tools can have multiple and often non-intuitive\nfailure modes [ 33, 157]. For instance, they can introduce subtle,\nnon-intuitive errors that a human would not introduce, further\ncomplicating evaluation [156]. As it stands, this requires develop-\ning an expertise and a well-adjusted confidence that is distinct from\nexisting domain expertise, with, for example, “developers [needing]\nto learn new craft practices for debugging” [156]. Moreover, as noted,\nGenAI models are non-deterministic [136]. This is arguably a neces-\nsary trade-off within current GenAI systems, as it enables diversity\nof output [136, 156], yet it exacerbates the challenge of confidence\nadjustment, particularly when working iteratively across prompt-\ning and output evaluation (as per §3.1). How confident users should\nbe in their evaluation ability, and how much effort they should in-\nvest in evaluation, partly depends on how much non-determinism\nthey can expect in the output. Indeed, manufacturing designers\nco-creating with GenAI were,“unable to determine whether. . . design\nfeatures were intended or caused by algorithmic glitches” [70]. More\nbroadly, as per §3.1, output failures can be attributed to the user’s\nprompt or parameter settings, or the system’s non-determinism or\ntraining data, without an obvious way to disentangle these, further\ncomplicating confidence adjustment, particularly for non-expert\nusers [157, 197].\nFuture work should examine how different reasons for output\nfailures affect users’ ability to appropriately adjust their confidence\nin their evaluation ability, and how that influences their evaluation\nof and reliance on GenAI output.\nObtaining appropriate measures for confidence adjustment.\nAdjusting confidence in output evaluation typically requires ob-\njective measures of performance for comparison (e.g., the number\nof errors a user correctly detected in the output), but the quality\nof generated content and its uses may be more difficult to evalu-\nate objectively (e.g., consider how one would objectively evaluate\nthe quality of an LLM-generated email) [ 87, 99]. The benefits of\ngenerated content may also be diffuse and indirect. For example,\nparticipants co-writing with an LLM found that seeing the LLM’s\nsuggestions was helpful even when they did not implement them"}

This implies subjectivity in the workflow which, although\nvalid, makes it challenging to adjust one’s confidence. Even with\nuse-cases that involve subjectivity, such as creative tasks, users\nneed to adopt an appropriate reliance strategy, which requires well-\nadjusted confidence. For example, given the ease of idea generation\nwith GenAI, how can users be confident that the ideas generated\nby such systems are in fact helpful for their ideation process, rather\nthan merely feeling like they are helpful?\nFuture work should develop more varied objective measures of\noutput quality, and explore how user-provided subjective measures\nof quality can support users’ ability to adjust their confidence in\noutput evaluation (e.g., by considering the self-consistency of their\nreports [87]).\n3.3 Automation strategy and generative AI\nworkflows\nBeyond the metacognitive demands implied in the local interaction\nwith GenAI, the generality of GenAI—its applicability to a wide\nrange of tasks[ 157]—poses a higher-level question to end-users\nabout their workflow automation strategy: whether they should\n“employ Generative AI, how, and how much is the utility of incor-\nporating generated contents compared to conventional approaches”\n[34]. Sarkar [154] describes this change as a shift from production\nto ‘critical integration’, where “the output of AI systems will need\nto be integrated into a wider workflow involving human action” , a\nprocess requiring critical evaluation of outputs. We argue that this\nimposes a distinct metacognitive demand on users that must make\nthese decisions, akin to [ 149], who make a similar argument for\ndigital storage and memory. That is, users must have self-awareness\nof the applicability and potential impact of using GenAI for their\nworkflow; well-adjusted confidence in the ability to complete a task\nmanually versus with GenAI; and metacognitive flexibility in adapt-\ning workflows to GenAI (Figure 2d-e). We first briefly summarize\nearly evidence on how GenAI is impacting user workflows, and then\ndiscuss the role of metacognition in users’ workflow automation\nstrategy.\n3.3.1 Early impact of generative AI on user workflows.Research\non real-world GenAI workflows, primarily in AI-assisted coding,\nsuggests that tools like GitHub Copilot alter users’ workflows in\ndiverse ways [166]. Although many changes may be positive and\nrelated to productivity boosts [40], we focus on the challenges to\nillustrate the demand for metacognition. In a sample of undergrad-\nuate students with programming experience, working with Copilot\non realistic programming tasks was perceived to be challenging\n(although participants still strongly preferred it) [ 188]. Most rel-\nevantly, the generation of a long piece of code, particularly with\nerrors, required participants to switch between coding, reading,\nand debugging, resulting in a high cognitive load (also reported\nin [14] and, in the domain of AI-assisted programming education,\nin [143]).

Automated\nsystem design has adhered to best practices in human factors en-\ngineering to mitigate the impact of these challenges in specific\ncontexts, such as driving. However, current GenAI systems present\ntwo key differences: they are applicable to a wide range of tasks\n(‘generality’ [157]), and as a result, they are also widely available\nto users with different levels of domain expertise, system training,\nand workflow standardization, in line with broader automation\ntrends [82]. Thus, current systems shift the task of managing one’s\nautomation strategy to the user, who may lack expertise or training,\nleaving them to manage their attention and re-structured work-\nflows as they see fit—a distinct metacognitive demand of GenAI.\nBroadly, these changes pertain to understanding and then adapting\none’s workflows. We discuss each of these below.\n3.3.2 Understanding one’s workflows: self-awareness and confidence\nadjustment. One key question that pertains to users’ automation\nstrategy is whether to automate a certain task. Inappropriate re-\nliance on GenAI may result in lost productivity, increased risk of\nerrors, or potential de-skilling [23]. Users must therefore have self-\nawareness of the applicability of GenAI for their workflow, and\nwell-adjusted confidence in their ability to complete the task man-\nually versus with GenAI [156] (Figure 2d). Put simply, it requires\nanswering a version of the following questions: do I know whether\nan available GenAI system can help my workflow; do I know how\nto work with it effectively in the context of my workflow; and how\nconfident am I in this knowledge? [114]. In end-user programming,\nthis is known as the ‘attention investment’ problem, in which users\nmust conduct a cost-benefit analysis to decide whether the potential\nattention costs saved from programming a manual task outweigh\nthe attention costs of implementing the program [20].\nEarly research suggests that some users, particularly novices\nin GenAI and/or the task domain, lack sufficient self-awareness\nand well-adjusted confidence for working effectively with GenAI\nsystems. For example, programming students in [143] repeatedly\nspent time editing Copilot suggestions before abandoning them\nand moving on, or tried to coerce Copilot to provide a correct\nsuggestion, two unproductive interaction patterns that suggest\npotential over-reliance on GenAI. Similarly, some less experienced\nprogrammers in [14] were particularly excited about Copilot and\nwould over-rely on it before manually attempting any of the tasks\nthemselves. When compared with the relative absence of such\ninteractions among experienced developers (e.g., [14, 188]), these\ninteraction patterns illustrate a potential lack of metacognitive self-\nawareness and confidence in managing one’s workflows. However,\nKazemitabaar et al. [89] found no evidence of over-reliance among\nnovice programmers when learning programming using GenAI."}

Further in-depth research is needed on the\nimpact of GenAI on realistic workflows, including understanding\nthe role of user self-awareness and confidence, particularly for\nuse-cases outside of programming.\nDeciding to rely on GenAI is a form of ‘cognitive offloading’—the\nuse of tools external to the mind (e.g., calendars), to reduce the cog-\nnitive demand of a task (e.g., remembering an event) [148]. With\nGenAI, although the intent is often (but not always) to produce an\nexternal artefact, many cognitive processes that are traditionally\ninvolved in such production are at least partly ‘offloaded’ to GenAI,\nsuch as ideation, memory retrieval, and reasoning. For example,\nalthough users prompt systems with instructions to generate text,\nit’s the systems which often generate ideas, retrieve relevant infor-\nmation, and structure it into arguments. Psychological research has\nexplored how metacognition affects people’s decisions to engage\nin cognitive offloading, and can therefore inform our understand-\ning of the metacognitive demands pertinent to users’ automation\nstrategy [69, 148, 161]. Studies find that people’s self-confidence in\ntask performance or knowledge is a strong determinant of their use\nof external reminders [22, 68, 79], and search for external informa-\ntion [49, 158]. That is, a lower self-confidence in one’s abilities is\nassociated with more cognitive offloading. The above GenAI user\nstudies demonstrate a similar pattern, where less experienced users\nwere more likely to show patterns consistent with over-reliance on\ntools like Copilot. Critically, studies on cognitive offloading show\nthat even when accounting for people’s objective performance on\na task, their subjective self-confidence still influences the decision\nto engage in cognitive offloading [22, 68].\nFuture work should explore how subjective self-confidence re-\nlates to users’ automation strategies with GenAI, and how users,\nparticularly novices, can be supported in having increased self-\nawareness and a well-adjusted confidence to ensure appropriate\nreliance on GenAI (see also §4).\n3.3.3 Adapting one’s workflows: metacognitive flexibility.Along-\nside self-awareness and confidence, working with GenAI requires\nmetacognitive flexibility to be able to effectively adapt one’s work-\nflow (Figure 2e). For example, users should be able to recognize\nwhen and how the use of GenAI interferes with their workflow,\nresulting in a net productivity loss, and adjust accordingly. As dis-\ncussed above, the challenges that some Copilot users faced suggest\nan under-development of this domain-specific metacognitive abil-\nity. Conversely, emerging evidence suggests that some experienced\nusers do employ metacognitive flexibility in their workflows with\nGenAI. For example, some users with prior Copilot experience\ndisable it entirely due to excessive disruption to their workflows\n[14]. In [ 103], 26 percent of surveyed programmers cite the dis-\ntracting nature of GenAI suggestions, and 38 percent cite the time-\nconsuming nature of debugging or modifying generated code, as\n‘very important’ reasons for avoiding tools like Copilot. Certain\ndata scientists in [119] similarly expressed skepticism towards AI\nassistance, particularly for difficult-to-understand generated code.\nLikewise, many manufacturing designers in [ 70] who struggled\nwith GenAI ultimately avoided it altogether in their process.\nOther users take a more nuanced approach: “‘I turned off auto-\nsuggest and that made a huge difference. Now I’ll use it when I know\nI’m doing something repetitive that it’ll get easily, or if I’m not 100\npercent sure what I want to do and I’m curious what it suggests. This\nway I get the help without having it interrupt my thoughts with\nits suggestions”’ [156]. More broadly, only about 20-30 percent of"}

This\nway I get the help without having it interrupt my thoughts with\nits suggestions”’ [156]. More broadly, only about 20-30 percent of\nCopilot suggestions are accepted by users [211].\nThis evidence also hints at relevant differences between system\ninterfaces and interaction modes that should be considered in the\ncontext of metacognitive demands and adapting workflows. Au-\ntomated suggestions reflect tighter integration between manual\nwork and GenAI, and no metacognitive demands associated with\nprompting, yet they nevertheless present challenges such as inter-\nruptions. In contrast, prompt-based interactions enable more user\ncontrol over workflows but present metacognitive demands (as per\n§3.1.1). User-controlled suggestions may be a middle-ground, but\npresent their own challenges in terms of inferring system intent (as\nper §3.2.1). Deciding between these approaches as a user may con-\ntribute to the metacognitive demand associated with determining\nautomation strategy (see also [171]).\nThis is not to suggest that users’ approaches to workflow adapta-\ntion above are necessarily optimal for productivity, but rather that\nthey reflect self-awareness and confidence in experienced users\nabout how GenAI impacts their workflow, and the exertion of\nmetacognitive flexibility in an effort to change this. As Sarkar et al.\n[156] conclude, these emerging ad hoc strategies hint at “a new\ncognitive burden of constantly evaluating whether the current situa-\ntion would benefit from LLM assistance” —a burden that we identify\nas distinctly metacognitive. Future work should characterize the\nrole of metacognitive flexibility in adapting one’s workflows across\ndifferent GenAI interfaces and interaction modes.\n4 ADDRESSING THE METACOGNITIVE\nDEMANDS OF GENERATIVE AI\nThe metacognitive demands posed by GenAI can be addressed\nin two complementary ways: (1) improving users’ metacognition\nvia metacognitive support strategies that can be integrated into\nGenAI systems, and (2)reducing the metacognitive demand of GenAI\nsystems by designing task-appropriate approaches to explainability\nand customizability. The distinction between the two approaches\nis not clean-cut, yet helps frame the design space.\nMultiple lines of evidence suggest that metacognition can be im-\nproved, and that individuals who are supported in specific metacog-\nnitive monitoring or control abilities can significantly improve\ntheir performance in metacognitively demanding tasks [ 45, 52].\nThis applies across different age groups (from children to adults)\n[8, 39, 48], tasks (e.g., lecture comprehension or mathematical rea-\nsoning) [27, 80, 91, 96], time-scales (i.e., immediately as well as\ndelayed) [121], and learning settings (i.e., solitary as well as social)\n[137]. As such, interventions to improve the metacognition of users\nworking with GenAI could be one effective way of meeting the\ndemands of these systems. This includes embedding metacognitive\nsupport strategies—for example, supporting users’ planning and\nself-evaluation—directly into GenAI systems. Interventions can be\nadapted to the metacognitive abilities and GenAI experience of each\nuser to provide the appropriate level of support, making productive\nuse of GenAI’s model flexibility and generality."}

Planning is a task-oriented metacognitive strategy\nentailing both the definition of clear goals (i.e., self-awareness) and\ndevising a comprehensive approach for achieving them by breaking\nthem down into smaller, manageable steps (i.e., task decomposi-\ntion) [21]. Planning-related interventions can support both of these\naspects as users work with GenAI systems.\nAs discussed below in §4.1.2, self-evaluation interventions can\nhelp users reflect on their task goals and approaches to task de-\ncomposition [74]. However, tasks may nevertheless be complex\nor ambiguous, often requiring gathering, organizing, and synthe-\nsizing information in a nonlinear manner distinct from the linear\nconversational interfaces in most GenAI systems today. For ex-\nample, people can engage in multi-level planning, where hours,\ndays, and weeks have to be considered simultaneously [6]. More\nflexible interfaces can support the crafting of a complex prompting\nstrategy by enabling open-ended exploration of task goals and the\nrelationships between them during the planning process.

Similar systems have been shown\nto improve users’ planning and other metacognitive processes [38].\nWhen applied to the prompting and output evaluation process it-\nself, these approaches can make users aware of where they are in a\ntask. They can also help them encode information in personalized\nrepresentational schemas [141], which can help users understand\nthe underlying mechanisms of a GenAI system, its capabilities, and\nfailure points. Such an understanding can in turn mitigate the risks\nof inappropriate evaluation of, and confidence in, AI-generated\noutput.\nPlanning-related interventions can also support users directly in\ntask decomposition, improving prompt effectiveness via more ex-\nplicit and discrete instructions. One promising approach is ‘prompt\nchaining’, which involves“decomposing an overarching task into a se-\nries of highly targeted sub-tasks, mapping each to a distinct LLM step,\nand using the output from one step as an input to the next” [203, 204].\nAlongside improving the LLM’s ability to execute complex tasks,\nchaining helped participants “think through the task better” , and\nthereby make more targeted edits to improve their prompting [204].\nChaining also increased users’ self-awareness of their goals: the\nability to decompose tasks led some participants to create more\ngeneralizable outputs better suited to their broader goals [203].\nPlanning can also help users address the ‘fuzzy abstraction\nmatching’ problem [156], that is, translate their goals and inten-\ntions into executable actions—a form of externalization where ‘tacit’\nknowledge is made into explicit prompts [ 130]. This can be sup-\nported through feedforward design [34] (as distinct from feedback\n[191]): inviting an action and communicating what exactly the user\ncan expect as a result.15 For example, feedforward can be used to\ninform users that a vague, high-level prompt is unlikely to achieve\ntheir task before they submit it. As Vermeulen et al. [191]argue, “the\nmore complex a system or interaction context gets, the larger the need\nwill be for elaborate feedforward in order to aid users in achieving\ntheir goals” . Prompt chaining is an example of a sequential feed-\nforward approach, surfacing inputs, outputs, and the underlying\nprompt structure for users to explore [204]. However, feedforward\ninformation can also increase cognitive load [42], so the right bal-\nance, particularly for complex systems, remains to be explored. The\nPrompt Middleware framework uses feedforward at different levels\nof complexity to guide users towards effective prompts and scaffold\ndomain expertise into the process [113].\nFigure 3 provides a hypothetical example of a planning-focused\nmetacognitive intervention that could be implemented in a con-\nversational interface such as ChatGPT. Rather than requiring an\nentire chain structure with full control over inputs and outputs, the\nbenefits of chaining could be derived by surfacing a relevant set of\nkey questions to users in a more accessible format.\n4.1.2 Self-evaluation. Self-evaluation involves enabling users to\nreflect on their knowledge, strategies, and performance, and their\nrespective level of confidence in these. Interventions that cue users\nto reflect on their goals and strategies via question prompts or\nconversational interfaces have been shown to improve outcomes\nin the workplace [92, 122, 209], education [51], and other domains\n[17, 147].

GenAI systems, with their model flexibility and generality,\n15This is also a form of explanation; see §4.2.1.\nhave the potential to adaptively nudge this kind of self-evaluation\nat key moments during user workflows, effectively acting as a coach\nor guide for users [78].\nSelf-evaluation can be used to support effective prompting. For\nexample, Gmeiner et al . [70] employed human experts to guide\ndesigners during their interaction with GenAI systems; users appre-\nciated critical questions that guided self-evaluation and thought this\nimproved prompting. Gmeiner et al. suggest that GenAI systems\ncan proactively offer similar context-aware self-reflection prompts\nto support users in thinking through problems. Self-evaluation in-\nterventions can rely on a range of design elements to support users\nin clarifying their task goals, including temporal aspects (e.g., con-\nsidering past tasks or broader project timelines), comparison (e.g.,\nwith similar tasks), and discovery (e.g., through re-framing tasks)\n[17].\nSelf-evaluation during the output stage can include interventions\nthat surface previous outputs and ask users to ‘think aloud’ about\ntheir thought processes, promoting self-awareness in ‘real time’\nand supporting users in detecting hallucinations in GenAI outputs\n[84]. For example, simple textual prompts promoting self-awareness\nsignificantly decreased participants’ susceptibility to incorrect (al-\nbeit realistic) information [153]. Likewise, self-explanation prompts\nimproved students’ accuracy in evaluating their own understand-\ning of information [201]. GenAI systems could also probe for and\nproactively respond to user uncertainty. Even including a ‘not sure’\noption for users auditing LLMs, can enable them “to reflect on the\ntask specification and the appropriateness of the tests considered”\n[146].\nSelf-evaluation is particularly promising for augmenting GenAI\nexplainability, where it can help increase users’ receptiveness to\nexplanations that seek to update their mental models of GenAI\nsystems [4, 171] (see §4.2.1 for more on explainability). For example,\nself-reflection probes can ask users to reflect on their mental model\nand associated confidence [97].\nGenAI systems also provide opportunity for interactive metacog-\nnitive support, encouraging self-evaluation and suggesting adjust-\nments to metacognitive strategies based on context [202]. For in-\nstance, systems could interactively guide users through the steps of\na problem rather than simply providing a solution [70]. Indeed, the\nsuccess of pair programming often stems from the extensive verbal-\nization between programmers, and resultant self-evaluation, rather\nthan the division of labor [75]. Interactions with GenAI systems\ncould replicate this with a similar level of reflective depth. Enabling\nusers to critically evaluate AI outputs can build self-awareness by\nforcing users to rationalize their decisions to the GenAI system\n[156], enhance metacognitive flexibility by providing users with\ndifferent perspectives on their task [15], and adjust confidence by\nadapting explanations to the users’ needs and the models’ con-\nfidence [110]. Moreover, it can also provide critical feedback to\nGenAI systems themselves.\nHowever, there are also potential pitfalls in interactivity. As per\n§3.2, processing fluency can lead to inflated confidence without\nnecessarily improving objective accuracy. The design of intuitive\ninterfaces for GenAI systems might therefore inadvertently give\nusers a misleading sense of competence, increasing the risk of er-\nrors (likewise discussed in cognitive psychology [153]).

Another\napproach is designing the complexity of AI-generated content ac-\ncording to the cognitive load experienced by the user [177]. This\ncould involve dynamic adaptations, such as recognizing implicit\nintent [34], providing summaries when the user is overwhelmed,\nor escalating the complexity when the user demonstrates high pro-\nficiency and engagement. Supporting self-management efficiently\nalso depends on task demands [74]. For example, [1] and [164] sug-\ngest that in the context of solving logical puzzles, intelligent tutors\nshould offer backwards-oriented workflows (e.g., using prompts\nto encourage thinking about the negation of the actual solution),\nrather than focusing on forward-oriented workflows. In a data sci-\nence context, Gu et al. [74] propose that GenAI tools can offer “a\n‘think’ mode for specific planning suggestions, a ‘reflection’ mode for\nconnecting decisions and highlighting potential missed steps, and an\n‘exploration’ mode for higher-level planning suggestions” .\nDeciding when to present any GenAI support is another design\nchoice affecting self-management. In AI-assisted decision-making,\nSteyvers and Kumar [171] distinguish between AI support provi-\nsion that is on-demand (user-requested) and sequential (occurring\nafter a user makes an independent decision), among others. Apart\nfrom facilitating engagement at opportune moments, the sequen-\ntial paradigm is presumed to encourage independent reflection by\nthe user. Park et al. [138] similarly argue that “slower” interfaces\nespecially enable these benefits, as the waiting time often gets used\nfor reflective thinking about the task at hand (see also [147]). Alter-\nnatively, workflows can be more dynamic. For example, pathology\nrequires highly specialized, moment-to-moment judgments; in this\ncontext, the user capability to control and modify search algorithms\non-the-fly can be particularly beneficial [28].\nFigure 5 provides a hypothetical example of a metacognitive in-\ntervention focused on self-management and self-evaluation.

Critically, it offers options to ignore\nthe suggestion, schedule it for later, or change proficiency settings\n(i.e., self-confidence).\n4.2 Reducing metacognitive demands\nIn addition to improving users’ metacognition during their inter-\naction with GenAI, systems should be designed to reduce their\nmetacognitive demands . Target areas for this include the explain-\nability and customizability of GenAI systems.\n4.2.1 Explainability. We adhere to the definition of explainability\nas that which enables “people’s understanding of the AI to achieve\ntheir goals” [174]. To this point, §3 demonstrated how users strug-\ngled to understand GenAI systems and achieve their goals due to\nGenAI’s metacognitive demands. We focus on those using GenAI\nsystems as tools in their workflow (in contrast to, e.g., those en-\ngaging solely with GenAI system outputs, or overseeing regulatory\naspects), in line with the context-specificity of explainability advo-\ncated by research on HCXAI [57, 104, 175].\nFrom the perspective of metacognitive demand, by providing con-\ntextual and performance information alongside the system inputs\nand outputs, explainability should help partlyoffload metacognitive\nprocessing from users’ minds and onto the system interface. As we\nillustrate below, explainability approaches can surface the infor-\nmation necessary for adjusting confidence in prompting, output\nevaluation, and automation strategy. Moreover, by providing action-\nable information, explainability can enable users’ self-awareness\nand metacognitive flexibility [116].16\nExplainability for GenAI systems should help users adjust their\nconfidence in their ability to prompt, evaluate outputs, and deter-\nmine their automation strategy, particularly given the multiple,\nnon-intuitive failure modes common to GenAI systems, and other\nchallenges [104]. For example, explanations that map each aspect\nof an output to aspects of the prompt (e.g., using attention visual-\nization [179]), and compare this to examples of effective prompts\n[25, 85], can help users disentangle issues with their prompt from\nthose stemming from model performance, thereby supporting con-\nfidence adjustment for prompting ability. Likewise, ‘co-auditing’ a\nGenAI system by revealing the model’s step-by-step actions (e.g., in\nspreadsheet software [105]) can enable users to understand exactly\nwhat’s involved in a longer workflow [71], and help them adjust\ntheir confidence in their evaluation ability. For example, an explana-\ntion that introduces domain concepts or terminology unfamiliar to\nusers can signal insufficient domain expertise to evaluate this out-\nput [165], and prompt further explanation. Finally, indicating model\nuncertainty [19, 174, 198], for example, by means of color-coding\n[167], and an explanation for that uncertainty [ 5, 190], can also\nhelp users disentangle the role of their prompting and output eval-\nuation ability from that of models’ capabilities, further supporting\nconfidence adjustment [197].\n16In this sense, explainability can also be viewed as a metacognitive support strategy\nas per §4.1.\nThe broader user workflow that encompasses the local inter-\naction with GenAI constitutes an important usage context for ex-\nplainability (see also [ 99, 174]). To this end, global explanations\nabout model capabilities for a given task can help users adjust their\nconfidence in their ability to complete the task manually versus\nwith GenAI support (i.e., determining their automation strategy)\n[85]. Indeed, for AI-assisted coding, users requested information\nabout overall output quality and runtime performance [174].\nExplainability can also reduce the metacognitive demand for user"}

Indeed, for AI-assisted coding, users requested information\nabout overall output quality and runtime performance [174].\nExplainability can also reduce the metacognitive demand for user\nself-awareness and metacognitive flexibility. For example, explana-\ntions about effective prompting strategies for a given task—most\nfrequently requested by users in a GenAI-assisted coding system\n[174]—can help users translate their goals into actionable prompts\nor flexibly adjust their prompts (which can equally be viewed as\nsupporting their metacognitive abilities, as in feedforward design\n[191]). Moreover, granular model uncertainty estimates, such as\nline-level highlighting of generated code, can support users in pri-\noritizing their output evaluation [190, 198, 199], thereby enabling\nmetacognitive flexibility. In sum, these approaches to explainabil-\nity all aim to reduce the metacognitive demand of GenAI systems,\nenabling users to take concrete actions, including ‘mental state’\nactions (e.g., confidence adjustment), system interactions (e.g., up-\ndating prompts), or actions external to the system (e.g., completing\na task without GenAI) [116].\nAs suggested in §4.1.2, the above explainability approaches can\nbe augmented via metacognitive self-evaluation interventions that\nencourage self-awareness. GenAI offers a unique opportunity to\nfurther augment these interventions through interactivity, as advo-\ncated in recent work [10, 100, 101, 123, 192], including for GenAI\nspecifically [174]. Interactivity could be especially important for\nGenAI explainability, as due to GenAI’s model flexibility, generality,\nand originality, users’ explanation needs will be as diverse as their\nuse-cases, outputs, and metacognitive abilities.\n4.2.2 System customizability. The question of how much control to\ngive users—system customizability, or how many ‘knobs’ a user can\nadjust—is another design choice that can moderate the metacogni-\ntive demands of GenAI [42, 119].\nOn one hand, increasing customizability can increase the demand\nfor self-awareness (e.g.,“are any of the settings relevant to my task?” ),\nwell-adjusted confidence (e.g., “did any of the settings affect the\noutput quality, or is it related to my prompting?” ), task decomposition\n(e.g., “what is the right order to adjust settings for each of my sub-\ntasks?”), and metacognitive flexibility (e.g., “which settings should I\nadjust to improve my output, if any?” ). This may increase cognitive\nload, particularly for novice users. Indeed, in Perry et al. [139], half\nof the users did not adjust any model parameters, even though\nmany produced insecure code using an AI assistant. To this end,\nthe Prompt Middleware framework aims to reduce the demand\nto craft prompts from scratch, enabling users to choose limited\ncustomizability [113].\nOn the other hand, increased customizability can support\nmetacognition, particularly for more advanced users. For exam-\nple, consider the temperature setting, which determines the extent\nof non-determinism in GenAI outputs, and therefore the likelihood\nof hallucinations. Allowing users to change this setting can support\nmore flexible and self-aware problem-solving in experienced users,"}

During programming, the system can provide self-evaluation prompts to encourage user reflection\non bugs and purpose of the code (right side of the figure). To decrease cognitive load if evaluation is not wanted, the user has\nthe option to schedule evaluation for later, or set their own confidence level to increase or decrease the amount of suggestions\n(the ‘proficiency settings’ in the bottom right of the figure). The system could also prompt the user to think about the broader\nwork context, for example whether this code-snippet may be relevant somewhere else in the overall code as well. The user has\nthe options to ignore this suggestion, look at the other relevant areas now, or review them later (bottom left of the figure).\nTo minimize cognitive load, the timing and frequency of prompts should be adapted to the users’ preferences, expertise, and\nworkflow.\nby presenting them with different and perhaps surprising perspec-\ntives [139]. Allowing users to find a task-appropriate temperature\nsetting that keeps the right balance between diversity and factuality\nof output, or constraining factuality in different ways (i.e., through\nautomated post-processing and deterministic fact-checking) could\ntherefore enable metacognitive flexibility and self-awareness. Cus-\ntomization may therefore increase users’ trust in and satisfaction\nwith output [135].\nOther settings include the size of the shortlist from which output\nis sampled, as well as the size of the output itself. Increasing the size\nof the output window may demand better-adjusted confidence to\nevaluate and integrate more information. However, it can also sup-\nport metacognition—by adjusting these parameters, users can work\non understanding which part of the output should be used and how,\npotentially also increasing explainability. Initial self-reports such\nas [152] suggest that in order to find the optimal system settings\nfor a task, users enter an interactive feedback loop with models,\nin which they clearly have to formulate their goals (promoting\nself-awareness), adjust their confidence in output evaluation, and\nflexibly adapt their workflow.\nWhere the balance lies between too much and not enough cus-\ntomizability needs exploring [34, 197]. Combining increased cus-\ntomizability with metacognitive support strategies (e.g., planning,\nself-evaluation, self-management) is a promising direction for fur-\nther research.\n4.3 Managing cognitive load while addressing\nmetacognitive demands\nThere is a risk that strategies to address metacognitive demands\nmay also increase cognitive load, due to the additional information\nthat users have to process, such as self-reflective prompts, a set\nof sub-goals resulting from task decomposition, or model explana-\ntions [46]. The relationship between metacognition and cognitive\nload is an active research area [46, 163, 193, 194], but it is plausible\nthat, although cognitive load may increase due to the processing\nrequirements of many metacognitive support interventions, the\nimprovement in metacognition may be accompanied by a simul-\ntaneous and larger reduction in cognitive load, resulting in a net\ndecrease in cognitive load. Some studies show that metacognitive\nsupport does not increase overall cognitive load [109, 210] (see also"}

Most importantly, we hypothesize that improved metacog-\nnition should result in a net improvement in output quality.\nLikewise, we propose that explainability, by partly offloading\nmetacognitive processing from users and onto the system, should\nreduce the cognitive load associated with metacognitive monitoring\nand control . However, it may increase the cognitive load associ-\nated with processing explanations [46]. To the latter point, some\ninteractive explanations have been found to increase cognitive load\n[18]. Ultimately, however, as users adapt to working with explain-\nable GenAI systems, we hypothesize that the result should be a\nnet reduction in cognitive load [134]. As noted above, system cus-\ntomizability involves a similar tension between cognitive load and\nmetacognition.\nTraining effects over time may be key, as users may gradually\ninternalize the metacognitive strategies, explanations, or customiza-\ntion settings, and no longer need to rely on external prompts [46].\nAccordingly, metacognition-related cognitive load should decrease,\nalthough it is less clear whether cognitive load associated with the\nprocessing of external prompts also sufficiently decreases. To this\npoint, [133] found that adaptive and gradual fading out of metacog-\nnitive prompts produced the largest performance benefits, as it\nprovided time for students to internalize metacognitive strategies,"}

The same\nmight be true for some types of explanations as well (e.g., global\nexplanations). Future research should study how metacognitive\ninterventions affect cognitive load as users learn to interact with\nGenAI systems over time, and how to optimally adapt or fade out\ninterventions over time. It is also important to explore other ways\nto optimize the balance between addressing metacognitive demand\nand overall cognitive load (e.g., through gamification [165]).\nLastly, and perhaps somewhat controversially, we highlight the\nvalue of ‘seamfulness’ in interface design for helping users reflect\non their technology use (as per §4.1.2 and [81, 196]). This idea can\nbe extended to question the ‘doctrine of simplicity’, which assumes\nthat interfaces should always be ‘easy’ or ‘natural’ to use [ 155].\nWe propose that some potential effort introduced by metacognitive\nsupport strategies and explanations may be justified, so long as\nthese are well-designed and act ultimately in the service of improved\nmetacognition and productivity with GenAI, a technology which\npromises to transform personal and professional work [155].\n5 CONCLUSION\nRussell [50] proposed that being literate in the “Age of Google”\nrequired a kind of ‘meta-literacy’—knowing how to read the search\ninterface, how to use it effectively, and what is even possible to\nsearch for. Analogously, as we offload more of our cognition to to-\nday’s GenAI systems, the demand for our metacognition increases\n[149].

Drawing on theories of dynamic capabilities and IT comple-\nments, we examine prompt adaptation—the adjustments users make to their inputs in response\nto evolving model behavior—as a mechanism that helps determine whether technical advances\ntranslate into realized economic value. In a preregistered online experiment with 1,893 par-\nticipants, who submitted over 18,000 prompts and generated more than 300,000 images, users\nattempted to replicate a target image in 10 tries using one of three randomly assigned mod-\nels: DALL-E 2, DALL-E 3, or DALL-E 3 with automated prompt rewriting. We find that users\nwith access to DALL-E 3 achieved higher image similarity than those with DALL-E 2—but only\nabout half of this gain (51%) came from the model itself. The other half (49%) resulted from\nusers adapting their prompts in response to the model’s capabilities. This adaptation emerged\nacross the skill distribution, was driven by trial-and-error, and could not be replicated by au-\ntomated prompt rewriting, which erased 58% of the performance improvement associated with\nDALL-E 3. Our findings position prompt adaptation as a dynamic complement to generative\nAI—and suggest that without it, a substantial share of the economic value created when models\nadvance may go unrealized.\n∗We thank Vivian Liu for early contributions to this project.

Recent research points to even\ngreater potential ahead, demonstrating advances in automating core scientific processes (Manning\net al. 2024), including tasks as complex as chemical research and proving mathematical theorems\n(Boiko et al. 2023, Romera-Paredes et al. 2024). The adoption of generative AI is also occurring\nat an unprecedented pace, with recent research showing that approximately 28% of U.S. workers\nare already using generative AI in their jobs—a rate that significantly outpaces early adoption of\npersonal computers and internet technology at comparable points in their diffusion (Bick et al.\n2024, Bright et al. 2024).\nAs with many other general-purpose technologies, the effectiveness of generative AI depends not\nonly on the technology itself, but on users’ ability to craft inputs that produce high-quality results.\nTo interact with generative AI systems, users provide written instructions—often referred to as\nprompts—that guide the model’s behavior. These prompts can range from simple commands (e.g.,\n“write a short story about a robot”) to highly detailed specifications tailored to particular outputs\n(e.g., a series of paragraphs instructing an AI system to implement a complete piece of software).\nIn this way, prompting serves as a complementary skill—one that, like spreadsheet modeling in the\nearly PC era, can determine the productivity impact of a given tool (Brynjolfsson and Hitt 2000).\nPrompting has quickly become an area of active research and practice. Scholars have developed\ntaxonomies of prompt engineering techniques (Oppenlaender 2023), documented recurring patterns\nin prompt construction (Schulhoff et al. 2024), and examined how developers embed prompts into\nsoftware systems (Liang et al. 2024). Other studies have explored prompting strategies for specific\napplications, including image generation (Don-Yehiya et al. 2023, Xie et al. 2023) and clinical\ndocumentation (Yao et al. 2024). In parallel, practitioners have built prompt libraries, shared\ntutorials, and developed tools to support prompt design. These developments signal a growing\nconsensus that prompting plays a meaningful role in extracting value from generative AI systems.\nYet despite this consensus, prompting remains understudied as a dynamic practice. Many\nprompt libraries and tutorials present effective prompts as reusable artifacts. But prompts that\nwork well with one model version may underperform or break entirely with the next (Liang et al.\n2024, Meincke et al. 2025). While recent research increasingly views prompting as an adaptive\nprocess, empirical evidence remains limited on how these strategies evolve—both as users refine\nprompts for a single model and as they adjust to model updates—and on how these changes\nultimately affect performance. This raises a broader question for individuals and organizations\ninvesting in prompting capabilities: Are prompt strategies transferable across model versions, or\nmust they be continually revised to match changing model behavior?\nTo begin exploring this question, we identify prompt adaptation 1 as a measurable behavioral\n1We use the phrase “prompt adaptation” to refer specifically to changes in user prompting behavior that arise\n2"}

We conceptualize\nprompt adaptation as a dynamic complement —that is, a user capability that adapts in response\nto changes in a technological system and is critical to realizing the full economic value of system\nimprovements. In contrast to static complements (e.g., fixed training, prompt templates), dynamic\ncomplements emerge through situated use with rapid feedback, respond to model-level change, and\nmay be enabled or suppressed by system design.\nTo assess the role of prompt adaptation in shaping realized performance—and to separate its\ncontribution from the direct effects of model improvement—we draw on data from a pre-registered\nonline experiment with 1 , 893 participants. In the study, participants were asked to replicate a\ntarget image using prompts submitted to one of three randomly assigned text-to-image models of\nvarying capability: DALL-E 2, DALL-E 3, or DALL-E 3 with an automated large language model\n(LLM)-based prompt revision. Each participant submitted at least 10 prompts in an effort to\nreproduce the image as closely as possible, with a large monetary bonus for top performers. By\ncomparing outcomes across arms—and by conducting a posthoc analysis that re-evaluates prompts\non alternative models—we estimate the extent to which users adapted their prompts in response\nto model improvements and how much this adaptation contributed to overall performance.\nWe find that participants assigned to DALL-E 3 produce significantly more faithful replications\nthan those assigned to DALL-E 2. Importantly, about half of this improvement comes from partic-\nipants adapting their prompts to exploit the new model’s capabilities—replaying the old DALL-E\n2 prompts on DALL-E 3 yields only about half the total improvement. Furthermore, we find that\nthis prompt adaptation is not limited to advanced “prompt engineers”—participants across the\nfull skill distribution benefit from refining their prompts after seeing how the advanced model re-\nsponds. Finally, we show that an attempt to automate prompt revision via GPT-4 rewriting does\nnot match the performance achieved by manual human adaptation; in fact, it substantially erodes\nthe gains from DALL-E 3. Together, these findings position prompt adaptation as a key mecha-\nnism through which users realize the value of rapidly advancing generative AI systems—and as a\nconcrete example of how digital complements must evolve to keep pace with technological change.\nIn terms of related literature and additional theory, this experiment builds on work in infor-\nmation systems, emphasizing the importance of dynamic, user-driven complements to digital tech-\nnologies. Research on IT-enabled dynamic capabilities has shown that the value of new systems\ndepends not only on technical infrastructure but on organizations’ ability to reconfigure routines\nand user behaviors in response to ongoing change (Bharadwaj 2000, Joshi et al. 2010, Teece et al.\n1997). Related work on post-adoptive IT use has demonstrated that users often engage only super-\nficially with new systems and that meaningful performance gains tend to emerge only when users\nexperiment with and refine their interaction strategies over time (Jasperson et al. 2005). Recent\nresearch on human-AI collaboration further underscores that interface design and task structure\nshape the degree to which users can learn from and adapt to model behavior (F¨ ugener et al. 2022).\nin response to evolving model capabilities—distinct from the broader practice of prompt engineering, which includes\nstatic best practices, libraries, and templates.\n3"}

We then introduce an experimental design that\nclosely mirrors this framework and describes the data used in our analysis. Next, we present our\nempirical findings, including a decomposition of the overall effect into components attributable to\nmodel improvements versus prompt adaptation, the impact of automated prompt revision, and\nheterogeneity across user skill levels. Finally, we compare these empirical results to the model’s\npredictions and conclude by discussing implications for organizations adopting generative AI.\n2 Conceptual Framework\nAs generative AI systems evolve, a user’s ability to adapt prompts for improved models can become\nan important source of realized performance gains. We develop a stylized conceptual framework\nto formalize how overall output quality depends on both the model’s capacity and the user’s skill\nand effort in prompt writing. Our goal is not to create a fully normative model. Rather, we wish\nto clarify the distinction between improvements directly attributable to the model itself versus\nthose arising from user adaptation as motivation for our experimental design.

This distinction highlights both a direct capacity-based effect of an improved\nmodel, a model effect, and an indirect effect driven by users adapting their prompts to the new\nmodel’s potential, a prompting effect.\nTo see this more formally, suppose the model is upgraded from capacity θ1 to θ2. Let the old\nprompting effort be x∗(θ1, s) and the new (adapted) prompting effort be x∗(θ2, s). Define the total\nimprovement in quality ∆Q is\n∆Q = Q\n\u0010\n(θ2, s, x∗(θ2, s)\n\u0011\n− Q\n\u0010\nθ1, s, x∗(θ1, s)\n\u0011\n.\nWe can decompose ∆Q into\n∆Q =\n\u0010\nQ(θ2, s, x∗(θ1, s)) − Q(θ1, s, x∗(θ1, s))\n\u0011\n| {z }\nModel Effect (M)\n+\n\u0010\nQ(θ2, s, x∗(θ2, s)) − Q(θ2, s, x∗(θ1, s))\n\u0011\n| {z }\nPrompting Effect (P)\n.\n(5)\nThe first term isolates the gain from simply upgrading the model (holding the user’s prompt\nstrategy fixed at the old optimum), while the second term represents any additional gain from\nprompt adaptation. In other words, even if θ improves, failing to adjust how prompts are written\ncould leave substantial performance gains on the table.\nThis decomposition naturally implies a prediction similar to Proposition 1 for each component\nof ∆Q that co-evolve with the changes in model capacity and user skill. In particular, when k is\nsmall, the following are proved in Appendix E.1.\nProposition 2. As user skill s improves, the model effect M decreases and the prompting effect P\nincreases.\nIntuitively, when costs are low and model capacity rises, higher-skilled users are already near\nthe upper bound of performance, so the direct model effect they receive may be smaller. In\ncontrast, users who can effectively refine prompts might benefit more from the new capacity, so the\nprompting effect they receive may be larger.

These models differ not only in technical capability but also in whether\nthey apply hidden large language model (LLM)-based modifications to user prompts. In the DALL-\nE 2 condition, participants interacted with an earlier-generation model that interprets prompts\ndirectly without intermediate rewriting. In contrast, the DALL-E 3 API, by default, forwards\nuser prompts to GPT-4 before image generation. This intermediate GPT-4 step rewrites the\nprompt—typically by adding detail or restructuring language—before passing it to the image model.\nThis behavior is intended to improve image quality but occurs silently and without user visibility.\nIn the DALL-E 3 (Revised) condition, we allowed this default behavior to proceed unaltered. In\nthe DALL-E 3 (Verbatim) condition, we attempted to suppress GPT-4-based prompt rewriting by\nprepending a hidden system message instructing the model to leave the user’s prompt unchanged.\nWhile some rewriting still occurred, the rate and extent of modifications were substantially reduced.\nIn all conditions, participants were unaware that their prompt might be rewritten or modified before\nimage generation.\nIn addition to model assignment, each participant was independently assigned one of 15 target\nimages. These images were drawn from three broad categories—business and marketing, graphic\ndesign, and architectural photography—to represent common use cases for text-to-image genera-\ntion. All images were sourced from platforms that permit free research use (e.g., Unsplash, Reshot,\nShopify, Pixabay, Gratisography)4.

CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining) is a neural network trained to jointly\nembed images and text into a shared latent space, such that semantically or visually similar items\nlie close together. By embedding both the target image and each generated image into this space\nand computing the cosine similarity between them, we obtain a quantitative measure of how closely\nthe generated image matches the target along both visual and conceptual dimensions.\nBecause the output of each generative model is stochastic, the same prompt can yield different\nimages across attempts. To account for this variability, we generated 10 images for each prompt\nand computed their cosine similarity to the target image individually. We then averaged these\n10 similarity scores to produce an expected quality score for each prompt—the primary outcome\nvariable used in our analysis. As a robustness check, we replicated all analyses using DreamSim,\na recently developed alternative to cosine similarity on CLIP embeddings that is based on percep-\ntual similarity and aligns more closely with human judgments. 6 The two measures were highly\ncorrelated, and our findings were consistent across both.\n3.3 Replay Analysis for Separating Model and Prompting Effects\nA central goal of our experiment was to distinguish how much of the performance improvement\nin image replication stems from using a more capable model versus how much comes from users\nadapting their prompts. Recall that the language of our conceptual framework shows that the total\nimprovement in output quality from upgrading a generative AI model with capacity θ1 to a model\nwith higher capacity θ2 can be written as:\n∆Q = Q\n\u0000\nθ2, s, x∗(θ2, s)\n\u0001\n− Q\n\u0000\nθ1, s, x∗(θ1, s)\n\u0001\n.\nWe decompose this change into two parts.

Full details are provided in Appendix C.4.\n6DreamSim (Fu et al. 2023) is designed to better capture human perceptions of image similarity than traditional\nembedding-based methods.

But how much of the overall performance improvement\nwe observe for DALL-E 3 users is due to the model’s enhanced technical capacity, and how much\nis due to users rewriting their prompts in response to that capacity? To answer this question, we\nturn to the replay analysis described earlier, which allows us to isolate these two effects identified\nin Equation 5 empirically.\nPanel A of Figure 2 presents the results. To estimate the model effect, we compare the per-\nformance of prompts originally written by DALL-E 2 participants when evaluated on DALL-E 2\n(the model they were written for) versus when evaluated on DALL-E 3 (Verbatim). Because these\nprompts were written without knowledge of DALL-E 3’s capabilities, any improvement reflects the\ngain from using a more capable model while holding the prompt fixed. We find that performance\nimproves by 0.0084 in cosine similarity when these prompts are evaluated on DALL-E 3 (p <10−8;\nbootstrapped standard errors clustered at the participant level), which accounts for approximately\n51% of the total difference in performance between the DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 arms.\nTo estimate the prompting effect, we then compare the performance of these same DALL-E 2\nprompts to the performance of prompts originally written by DALL-E 3 participants, both evaluated\non DALL-E 3. Because both sets of prompts are evaluated on the same model, any difference reflects\nthe effect of users adapting their prompts to the model’s capabilities. We find that this prompting\neffect accounts for the remaining 48% of the total improvement, corresponding to an increase of\n0.0079 in cosine similarity ( p = 0.024). The total treatment effect—i.e., the difference between the\noriginal DALL-E 2 prompts on DALL-E 2 and the original DALL-E 3 prompts on DALL-E 3—is\n0.0164.\nImportantly, when we apply prompts written by DALL-E 3 users to DALL-E 2, we observe\nno performance benefit relative to the original DALL-E 2 prompts (∆ = 0 .0020; p = 0.56). This\nasymmetry reinforces the idea that the gains from prompt adaptation depend on the model’s\ncapacity to act on that additional information.\nPanel B of Figure 2 illustrates these effects using a single target image. The two rows show\ndifferent prompts submitted for that target, along with the images they generate when evaluated on\neach model. In the top row, a prompt originally written by a DALL-E 2 participant yields a higher-\nfidelity image when replayed on DALL-E 3, demonstrating the improvement in output quality that\ncomes from upgrading the model while holding the prompt fixed. In the bottom row, a prompt\nwritten by a DALL-E 3 participant produces a noticeably lower-quality image when rendered by\n11"}

We regress performance\non indicators for model, prompting and total effects, as well as their interactions with participants’\nperformance decile (ranging from lowest to highest).\nWe make three observations. First, the interaction between total effect and performance decile\nis negative and statistically significant (−0.000115, p = 0.0152). This suggests that model improve-\nments reduce the overall gap between high and low-performing users, consistent with proposition\n1 in our conceptual framework. Second, the interaction between the model effect and performance\ndecile is also negative and statistically significant ( −0.000059, p = 0 .0210). This suggests that\nthe model effect mainly benefits the lower-performing users—consistent with our theoretical pre-\ndictions in proposition 2 and due to diminishing returns for those already near the performance\nceiling. Third, we do not find any evidence that the benefits of prompt adaptation vary across\nthe skill distribution in a meaningful way since the interaction between the prompting effect with\nperformance decile is not statistically significant ( −0.000056, p = 0 .2444).

In the DALL-E 3 (Revised) condition, user prompts were silently rewritten by\nGPT-4 before being submitted to the image model. Although participants in this condition still\noutperformed those using DALL-E 2 (∆ = 0 .0069; p = 0.042), they achieved substantially lower\nperformance than participants using DALL-E 3 without revision. On average, automated prompt\nrevision reduced the benefit of DALL-E 3 by 58% (95% CI: [40%, 76%]). Manual inspection of\nthe revised prompts in the DALL-E 3 (Revised) arm confirms that GPT-4 often added extraneous\ndetails or subtly altered the intended meaning of participant instructions, leading to degraded\nperformance. In this case, the automatic rewriting process was not well-aligned with the user’s goal\nof replicating a specific target image as faithfully as possible. More broadly, this result highlights a\npotential risk of using invisible system-level prompt rewriting: when the objectives of the rewriting\nmechanism are not tightly aligned with user intent, even well-intentioned modifications can interfere\nwith the user’s ability to effectively guide the model.\nTogether, these findings demonstrate that the performance gains observed when users are given\naccess to a more capable generative model stem from both improvements in model architecture\nand changes in user behavior. Participants assigned to DALL-E 3 not only achieve higher per-\nformance but also write longer, more refined prompts over time. Our replay analysis shows that\nthese adapted prompts account for nearly half of the overall performance improvement, with the\nremainder attributable to the model’s enhanced rendering capabilities.

Finally, automated prompt\nrewriting—when misaligned with user intent—fails to replicate the benefits of direct user adapta-\ntion. These results highlight the central role that prompting behavior plays in shaping how users\ninteract with and benefit from improved generative AI systems.\n5 Discussion and Conclusion\nOur findings contribute to the literature on human–AI collaboration and the economics of technol-\nogy by highlighting the role of prompt adaptation as a dynamic complement that co-evolves with\nmodel improvements (B¨ ohm and Schedlberger 2023). As generative AI models advance—often sub-\nstantially from month to month—organizations that fail to adapt their prompting strategies may\nforgo a meaningful share of the economic value these upgrades make possible.\nThis co-evolutionary pattern is not unique to AI. It echoes dynamics observed in earlier general-\npurpose technologies, where technical improvements often yielded modest returns until complemen-\ntary skills and practices evolved to match (Brynjolfsson 1993, David 1990). However, the pace of\ngenerative AI advancement introduces a distinctive challenge: the window for adaptation is far\nshorter. Organizations that treat prompting as a one-time investment rather than an ongoing ca-\npability risk failing to capture the full value of model upgrades—echoing the productivity paradox\nobserved when complementary assets lag behind technological potential (Brynjolfsson and Hitt\n2000, Brynjolfsson et al. 2021). Our findings complement this stream of work by offering direct em-\npirical evidence that a specific dynamic complement—user adaptation, specifically through prompt\nrefinement—accounts for roughly half of the realized performance gains associated with a model\nupgrade.\nThis finding extends research on IT-enabled dynamic capabilities (Bharadwaj 2000, Joshi et al.\n2010, Teece et al. 1997) and post-adoptive IT use, which emphasizes how value emerges through\nuser experimentation and learning over time (Jasperson et al. 2005). Prompt adaptation, as we\nobserve it, is not grounded in formal training or specialized skill. Participants in our study—none\nof whom were expert prompt engineers—improved performance through trial-and-error within a\nsingle session. This contrasts with earlier IT transitions, where complementary capabilities often\nrequired extensive training (Attewell 1992, Von Hippel 2006). The accessibility of prompt adapta-\ntion suggests a path toward more broadly distributed productivity gains—provided that users are\nsupported by scaffolds and interfaces that enable iterative refinement (Rogers 2003).\nAt the same time, this accessibility introduces risk. Over-optimizing for a particular model\nversion may reduce users’ ability to adapt as systems evolve. This behavioral lock-in resembles\nchallenges in architectural innovation, where tightly coupled routines inhibit flexibility when key\nsystem components change (Henderson and Clark 1990). Supporting long-term adaptation may\nrequire not just prompt training, but workflows and learning mechanisms that encourage ongoing\nexperimentation.\nFinally, our results caution against automated prompting systems that intervene without align-\n14"}

In our experiment, DALL-E 3’s automatic prompt rewriting—designed to\nenhance usability—reduced realized performance gains by 58%. This does not imply that au-\ntomated prompting is inherently counterproductive. In some settings, automation may simplify\nuse or improve consistency. But when the goals of a rewriting system diverge from those of the\nuser—as in our task, where general improvements (e.g., aesthetic quality or detail) were prioritized\nover faithful image replication—such interventions can interfere with the adaptive strategies users\nare developing. Similar challenges have been observed in other domains: for instance, in clinical\ndocumentation, automated prompt optimization improved consistency but still required manual\nrevision to ensure quality and alignment (Yao et al. 2024). These findings reinforce the broader\ninsight—rooted in both human–AI collaboration and dynamic capabilities research—that adaptive\nuser behavior is not merely a response to system performance but a critical input. Interventions\nthat disrupt this adaptive process risk eroding the very dynamic complements that make advanced\nsystems productive (F¨ ugener et al. 2022).\nWhile this study offers new insight into prompt adaptation, it has several limitations. First, our\nfocus was restricted to a single transition (from DALL-E 2 to DALL-E 3) and one type of genera-\ntive AI (text-to-image generation). Although our conceptual framework suggests these mechanisms\nmay generalize to other domains, further research is needed to assess how these dynamics play out\nin text generation, programming, scientific research, and other high-stakes settings. Second, we ob-\nserve short-run adaptation behavior in a controlled setting, whereas longer-term learning dynamics,\norganizational feedback structures, or team-based workflows may shape prompting strategies dif-\nferently in real-world environments. Third, while our replay analysis isolates the effect of prompt\nadaptation, we do not identify which specific types of prompt modifications (e.g., lengthening, lex-\nical substitution, structural rephrasing) have a causal effect on performance. Future work should\ninvestigate these finer-grained mechanisms to better inform prompting practices and interface de-\nsign.\nBuilding on these limitations, several promising research directions emerge. One direction\nis to examine prompt adaptation longitudinally—tracking how users develop durable heuristics\nthat generalize across domains and respond to shifting model behavior over time. Another line of\ninquiry involves organizational-level complements to prompting, such as shared prompt repositories,\ncollaborative refinement practices, or analytics dashboards that surface effective patterns. A third\narea concerns interface design—specifically, how features like auto-complete, prompt scoring, or\nreal-time feedback influence users’ ability to experiment and adapt. Finally, researchers might\nexplore how organizations balance standardization (which streamlines processes) with adaptability\nin prompting workflows, in order to avoid creating rigid routines that lag behind technical advances.\nFor researchers and practitioners interested in the economics of AI, our findings reinforce the\nidea that complements play a central role in shaping performance. The near-equal contributions\nof model improvements and prompt adaptation suggest that skill development and technological\nevolution must be treated as interdependent elements of innovation trajectories (Arthur 2009, Dosi\n1982). As generative AI continues to advance, organizations that invest in adaptive, not static,\n15"}

They did so by successively submitting prompts. In\nresponse to each submitted prompt, the model would generate an image, which was then displayed\nto the participant next to their assigned target image. Participants were instructed to make at\nleast 10 attempts at trying to recreate the target image within a 25-minute window, with no upper\nlimit on their number of attempts.\nAll interactions between participants and the generative AI models occurred on a custom-built\nonline interface designed to resemble OpenAI’s ChatGPT interface but with some adjustments\nrelated to our task (e.g., displaying the target image and the total number of attempts so far to the\nuser). On the right-hand side of the interface, participants were shown the target image they were\nrandomly assigned to recreate. On the left-hand side, participants were shown their previously\nsubmitted prompts as well as the resulting generated images. We placed the text box where\nparticipants were able to write and submit their prompts at the bottom of the interface. Prompts\nwere limited to a maximum of 1,000 characters. Participants were informed that their interactions\nwith their assigned model would be memory-less, i.e., the model retained no memory of previous\nprompts and only used the current prompt to generate each image. Before the task, participants\nwere provided with written and video instructions on how to interact with our experiment interface.\nOur task did not assume nor require prior experience with any generative AI tools.\nAfter the task, we surveyed participants’ opinions and preferences regarding generative AI tools.\nWe also inquired about their self-assessed occupational skills and how often they 1) engaged in cre-\native writing, 2) wrote specific instructions, and 3) engaged in any sort of computer programming.\nFinally, we collected socio-demographic data, such as age, gender, and occupation.\nA.2 Randomization\nWe randomized participants across two dimensions: the target image and the text-to-image genera-\ntive AI model that participants had access to. We randomized participants across both dimensions\nsimultaneously using complete randomization, generating 45 possible target image-model cells. We\nconducted a balance check after the conclusion of the experiment with a χ2 test across all cells.\nWith χ2 = 7.056, d f= 44, the resulting p-value equals to 1 and thus we cannot reject the null\nhypothesis that the proportions are equal across all 45 groups:\nH0 : p1 = p2 = ··· = p45\nParticipants were unaware of this randomization.\n19"}

DALL-E 2, which is referred to at points in the main text as the inferior model.\n2. DALL-E 3 (Verbatim), which is referred to at points in the main text as the superior model.\n3. DALL-E 3 (Revised), which is referred to at points in the main text as DALL-E 3 with\nRevision\nBoth the “verbatim” and “revised” versions of the DALL-E 3 treatment utilize the same underlying\nimage-generating model; the distinction lies in the pre-processing applied before submitting user\nprompts to OpenAI’s image-generating API. OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 system, by design, employs a\nGPT-4 model to rewrite user prompts, adding more detail before processing the modified prompt\nusing the DALL-E image-generating model. During our experiment, it was not possible to explicitly\ndisable this prompt rewriting feature of the DALL-E 3 system. To manage this behavior, we defined\ntwo treatments utilizing the DALL-E 3 model.\nIn the DALL-E 3 (Revised) treatment arm, we submit the participant’s prompt directly to\nOpenAI’s API and do not interfere with the default prompt rewriting process. In the DALL-E\n3 (Verbatim) treatment arm, we prepend a string instructing the GPT-4 model to not modify\nthe participant’s prompt before passing it forward to DALL-E 3. This string is never visible to\nparticipants and was modeled after a prefix specifically suggested in OpenAI’s online documentation\nfor the DALL-E 3 endpoint.8 We modified the recommended prefix slightly to account for the fact\nthat we did not expect our participants to always submit “extremely simple prompts.” The string\nwe prepended to prompts is found below:\n“I NEED to test how the tool works with my prompt as it is written. DO NOT add\nany detail; just use it AS IS:”\nPrepending this string to participants’ prompt did reduce the rate at which OpenAI’s endpoint\nmodified prompts, but compliance was not perfect. Thus, we view the “verbatim” treatment arm as\nmore of an intent-to-treat intervention. The GPT model still modified 59% of participant prompts.\nThe average token sort ratio (TSR) between the original prompt and the modified prompt was 77\nfor the DALL-E 3 (Verbatim) arm, compared to an average token sort ratio of 44 across the entire\nDALL-E 3 (Revised) treatment arm (a TSR of 100 denotes an exact string match). Conditional on\nany modification (any observations with TSR< 100), the average TSR between the original prompt\nand the modified prompt was 61 for the DALL-E 3 (Verbatim) arm, compared to an average TSR\nof 44 across the entire DALL-E 3 (Revised) treatment arm.\n8See here and here for online documentation.\n20"}

We also prevented users from\ncompleting the task on mobile devices or tablets. Data was collected between December 12, 2023\nand December 19, 2023. Participants were guaranteed a payment of$4 USD for completing the task\nand could earn an additional $8 USD (a 200% bonus) if they ranked in the top 20% of participants\nin DreamSim of their image most similar to the target (construction of DreamSim is described in\nsection C.5.1). The median time to complete our entire task, including a demographic survey, was\n22 minutes. Given that 20% of subjects received a bonus, the average compensation for participants\nin our study was $5.60 USD per person, or about $15 USD per hour. We explained the payment\nand incentive scheme to participants in full multiple times during the onboarding phase of the\nexperiment, and asked participants to confirm their understanding before they were allowed to\ncomplete the task. The onboarding process also included multiple attention checks; participants\nwho failed the first check were immediately disqualified. For subsequent checks, participants were\nrequired to retry until they demonstrated understanding.\nA.4 Model Endpoints\nWe used the following model endpoints and parameters to generate images from prompts:\n1. OpenAI API: We used the image generation endpoint of the official OpenAI Node.js library\nto generate images for user prompts during the experiment. For all treatment arms, we set the\nimage size parameter to be 1024 x 1024 pixels. For the DALL-E 3 (Revised) and DALL-E 3\n(Verbatim) treatment arms, we set the quality parameter to standard and the style parameter\nto natural.\n2.

The parameter values for image\nsize, and quality and style for the DALL-E 3 treatment arms, were set to the same values as\nin the experiment.\nA.5 Image Similarity Metrics\nThe primary outcome in our experiment is the similarity between each participant-generated image\nand the assigned target image, measured using the cosine similarity of CLIP embeddings (Radford\net al. 2021). CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining) is a neural network trained to jointly\nembed images and text into a shared latent space, such that semantically or visually similar items\nlie close together. By embedding both the target image and each generated image into this space\nand computing the cosine similarity between them, we obtain a quantitative measure of how closely\nthe generated image matches the target along both visual and conceptual dimensions.\nBecause the output of each generative model is stochastic, the same prompt can yield different\nimages across attempts. To account for this variability, we generated 10 images for each prompt\nand computed their cosine similarity to the target image individually. We then averaged these\n10 similarity scores to produce an expected quality score for each prompt—the primary outcome\nvariable used in our analysis. As a robustness check, we replicated all analyses using DreamSim, a\nrecently developed perceptual similarity metric that aligns more closely with human judgments. 9\nThe two measures were highly correlated, and our findings were consistent across both.\nA.6 Pre-registration\nThis study was pre-registered. The pre-registration document included our hypotheses, planned\nanalyses, and sample size justification. The pre-registration document can be found at URL\nremoved to maintain anonymity.\nB Example Prompts\nTable 2 presents the complete set of prompts and their corresponding generated images that were\nused in our analysis shown in Figure 1. The table displays three example target images (woman\nwith shopping basket, abstract painting with cross, and online shopping interface), with three\ndifferent participant-generated versions of each. For each target, we show examples of varying\n9DreamSim (Fu et al. 2023) is designed to better capture human perceptions of image similarity than traditional\nembedding-based methods.

We provide full details on this procedure in Section D. These images were gen-\nerated from December 26, 2023 - January 27, 2024. These images are not used for analyses\npresented in the main text, but were used for other pre-registered analyses. These additional\nanalyses are discussed in Section G.\n3. Post-hoc replayed images (Azure OpenAI endpoint): To decompose our overall effects\ninto model and prompting effects, we generated “counterfactual images” for each prompt writ-\nten under the DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 (Verbatim) treatments. In other words, we submitted\nall prompts written under both the DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 (Verbatim) treatments to both\nthe DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 (Verbatim) endpoints. Similarly to the resampling procedure\noutlined above, we generated 10 images per prompt per model: we generated a single replay\nfor each prompt-model pair from March 16-18, 2024, and then, to increase power, generated\nthe replications for these replay images from June 14-27, 2024. This replay process produced\na total of 20 images per prompt—10 under the original model, 10 under the counterfactual\nmodel. We re-submitted prompts to their original model to account for potential model drift,\nas this exploratory analysis was conducted multiple months after our initial data collection.\nFor consistency, this replay data is used throughout the main text of our paper.\nC.4 Sample Construction\nThe sample analyzed in the main text was constructed as follows:\n• The initial “raw” dataset collected during the experiment is comprised of 24,672 rows of raw\nprompt data (one prompt per row) generated by 2,059 participants.\n• We first removed rows with blank prompt entries, invalid prolific IDs, and unsuccessful at-\ntempts (logging errors). These exclusion criteria were pre-registered. This left us with 2,029\nparticipants and 24,123 prompts.\n• We next removed participants from our sample if they failed to submit at least 10 prompts\nor if a participant submitted the same prompt at least five times in a row at any point during\nthe task.

The specific language\nthat triggers these errors is constantly changing and not available publicly. If a prompt\ntriggered a safety error during the replication or replay process, we re-submitted the\nprompt up to 50 times or until the 10 original arm replications/replay samples had been\ncollected.

All of our main text results are robust to the exclusion of these\n“off-topic” prompts.\nC.5 Dependent Variables\nC.5.1 Image Similarity\nWe pre-registered two quantitative measures of image similarity: the cosine similarity of CLIP\nembedding vectors and a recently developed measure called ‘DreamSim’ (Fu et al. 2023). In the\nmain text, we present analyses using CLIP embedding cosine similarity, since it is likely more\nfamiliar to readers. Our results are qualitatively and quantitatively similar using DreamSim instead.\n• CLIP Embedding Cosine Similarity: To calculate CLIP embedding cosine similarity, we\nfirst generated CLIP embedding vectors (Radford et al. 2021) from Hugging Face (OpenAI\n2024) for each participant-generated image and for each target image. Unlike traditional\nimage embeddings that only encode visual features, CLIP embeddings also capture semantic\nrelationships between images and descriptive text. We then calculated the cosine similarity\nbetween each participant-generated image’s CLIP embedding and the relevant target image’s\nCLIP embedding.\n• DreamSim: DreamSim is an image similarity measure proposed recently by (Fu et al. 2023).\nThe authors claim that relative to a measure such as CLIP embedding cosine similarity,\nDreamSim measures image similarity in a way that more effectively captures human visual\nperceptions of similarity. Because the original DreamSim metric outputs a distance measure,\nwe invert this score ˜D = 1 − (original DreamSim) to recast it as a similarity score. After\ndoing so, both the inverted DreamSim and CLIP embedding cosine similarity are closer to 1\nwhen two images are more similar and closer to 0 when two images are more dissimilar.\nWe find that these two measures of image similarity are highly correlated in our sample (ρpearson =\n0.763, 95% CI: [0.755 0.770]), and our main results are robust to the use of either measure. We\npresent the results obtained when conducting our main text analyses using DreamSim in Sec-\ntion F.F.1.\nC.5.2 Prompt Length\nWe measure the lengths of prompts written by participants in our sample, both in terms of the\nnumber of words in a given prompt and in terms of the number of characters in a given prompt.\nIn our main text analysis, we present results only in terms of the number of words, since the two\noutcomes are highly correlated ( ρpearson = 0.9954, 95% CI: [0.99528, 0.99560]).\n27"}

Both measures use the vector embedding representation of each prompt in our\nsample, which we obtained using OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-small model (Neelakantan et al.\n2022). The two similarity measures are defined as follows:\n• Successive similarity: The successive similarity (ss) is a measure of the similarity of a par-\nticipant’s prompt to their immediately preceding prompt. We define the successive similarity\nof a prompt pi,n written by user i to the their immediately preceding prompt pi,n−1 as:\nssi,n,n−1 = E(pi,n) · E(pi,n−1)\n||E(pi,n)||||E(pi,n−1)||, (6)\nwhere E(pi,n) is the vector embedding representation of participant i’s nth prompt, pi,n.\nThis measure starts with participant i’s 2nd attempt, as the calculation requires a previous\nattempt.\n• Aggregate similarity: The aggregate similarity ( as) is a measure of how dispersed each\nuser’s prompts are around their “average prompt” (calculated by taking the element-wise\naverage of all prompt embeddings produced by the user). We define the aggregate similarity\nfor the 10 prompts written by a given user as:\nasi = 1\n10\n10X\nn=1\n∥E(pi,n) − E(pi,n)∥2\n2, (7)\nwhere E(pi,n) is again the vector embedding representation of participant i’s nth prompt,\npi,n, and E(pi,n) is the element-wise mean of all 10 of participant i’s prompts.\nC.5.4 Successive Prompt Token Sort Ratio\nStarting with each participant’s second prompt, we also calculated the token sort ratio (TSR) of\neach prompt pi,n to the immediately preceding prompt pi,n−1. TSR is a fuzzy string-matching\ntechnique (Singla and Garg 2012) that provides a continuous measure of how similar two strings\nare.\nC.5.5 Successive Prompt ‘Contains Previous Prompt’ Dummy\nStarting with each participant’s second prompt, we record whether each prompt pi,n contains the\nimmediately preceding prompt pi,n−1 as an exact substring.\n28"}

The model tags each word in a prompt\naccording to this framework, after which we count the total number of words corresponding to each\npart of speech for each prompt.\nC.5.7 Strategic Shifts\nIn addition to calculating the successive and aggregate similarity of prompts written by particular\nusers, we also attempt to identify particular moments when participants shift their approach to\nprompting. In order to do so, we adapt a method proposed in (Torricelli et al. 2023) (because they\nare conducting research in a different context, (Torricelli et al. 2023) refer to these shifts as “topical\ntransitions” as opposed to “strategic shifts”). To identify these strategic shifts, we first calculate\nthe mean cosine similarity ( MCS ) for the embedding vectors of every possible pair of prompts\nsubmitted in response to a given target image, t:\nMCS t = 2\nPt(Pt − 1)\nPtX\na=1\nPt−1X\nb=a+1\nCosineSim(E(pa,t), E(pb,t)).

(2023) uses the participant-level mean, as opposed to the\ntask-level mean, as the cutoff for a topical shift. We instead use the task-level mean because in our\nsetting, as it did not seem appropriate that half of each participant’s submitted prompts would be\nstrategic shifts.\nD Methods\nThis appendix provides additional methodological details to supplement the analyses presented in\nthe main text.\n29"}

The main text also demonstrated that\nperformance increases across successive attempts. To ensure our results are not driven by this\nimage-level or attempt-level variation, we replicated all analyses using the within-image-attempt\nZ-score of CLIP-cosine similarity for each image produced by participants. Formally, this is:\nZ(Simi,n,t) = Simi,n,t − Meann,t (Simi,n,t)\nSDn,t (Simi,n,t) (10)\nwhere Simi,n,t is the cosine similarity of user i’s image in attempt n to target image t. The mean\nand standard deviation are computed for each image-attempt pair, but across both the DALL-E\n2 and DALL-E 3 treatment arms. We also applied this rescaling to test the robustness of our\nDreamSim-based analyses.\n30"}

This stochasticity\nis controlled by a parameter called temperature, which could not be modified using the DALL-E API\nat the time of our experiment. To account for this model stochasticity, we generated 10 images for\neach prompt submitted by participants across all treatment arms. We then calculated the similarity\nbetween each replication and its corresponding target image, and computed an ”expected” CLIP\ncosine similarity and DreamSim score for each prompt by averaging across these samples.\nUsing these replicated images, we also calculated the standard deviation of cosine similarity\ninduced by this stochasticity. With the expected cosine similarity and its standard deviation\nper prompt, we computed a normalized Z-score for the observed image relative to its replication\ndistribution. This Z-score measures the extent to which the observed image is better or worse than\nwhat’s expected for that prompt and is used for further analysis in section G.\nWe generated these additional samples both for the original prompts on their assigned treatment\narms and by replaying prompts on the counterfactual arms, as introduced in Figure 2 in the main\ntext. Importantly, OpenAI updated its content filters between our initial experiment and image\nre-sampling. As a result, some prompts that originally produced images either generated no images\nor fewer images than requested during our regeneration attempts. This affected 1.8% (371 out of\n18,990 prompts) of the data in our sample under the ”replaying” procedure (Section C.C.3.3).\nE Main Text Analyses\nThis section provides detailed methodological information about the analyses presented in the main\ntext.\nE.1 Conceptual Framework\nThis appendix provides detailed derivations and proofs for the conceptual framework presented in\nthe main text. While the main text introduces the conceptual framework and key insights, here\nwe describe the model in more detail and develop its mathematical foundations and results more\nthoroughly.\nWe model a task where users attempt to replicate an object (such as an image) using a generative\nmodel. Perfect replication yields a maximum quality value of 1. The bounded quality function is\ndefined as:\nQ(θ, s, x) = 1 − exp\n\u0002\n−θ s x\n\u0003\n.\n31"}

Diminishing returns: As user effort ( x), increases, its marginal impact on quality becomes\nsmaller.\nWe assume a linear cost function of prompting:\nc(x) = k x,\nwhere k >0 represents the marginal cost of user effort, for example in terms of time spent. The\nuser’s utility given the quality and cost functions is\nU(θ, s, x) = 1 − e−θsx − k x.\nE.1.1 User Optimization\nThe user chooses the effort x ≥ 0 such that it maximizes U(θ, s, x).

To perform this decomposition, we consider a “counterfactual” quality function that uses\none model’s capacity but another model’s optimal prompt:\nQ\n\u0000\nθ2, s, x∗(θ1, s)\n\u0001\n= 1 − exp\n\u0000\n− θ2s x∗(θ1, s)\n\u0001\n(15)\nwhich is the quality obtained by using the model θ2 while choosing the prompting effort x∗(θ1, s)\nthat would have been optimal if the user actually had model θ1.

It displays the average cosine similarity score stratified by the\nreference image. A notable feature in this figure is the performance dip during the second recreation\nattempt across both treatment arms. This is likely due to participants’ initial misunderstanding\nof the model’s “memoryless” nature. Participants failed to recognize that context from previous\nprompts was not carried over to new iterations. We observed numerous prompts in the second\niteration across users that explicitly referenced the first prompt, a behavior that rarely occurred in\nsubsequent attempts. However, from the third prompt onward, participants appeared to grasp the\nindependence of each attempt, as evidenced by a marked decrease in cross-prompt references and\na corresponding rebound in performance.\nThe bottom pane of Figure 1B shows the average treatment effect (ATE) per iteration, which\nis the difference between the stratified averages of DALL-E 3 and DALL-E 2 in the top pane. 10\nTo test the widening impact of using DALL-E 3 on performance relative to DALL-E 2, we run\nthe following fixed effects linear model with participant-level ( i) clustered standard errors where\niteration is treated as a numeric variable:\nYi,n,t = β0 + β1 iteration + β2 I[dalleVersion = 3]i\n+ β3 iteration × I[dalleVersion = 3]i + γt + ϵi,n,t\n(19)\nThe coefficient estimates generated by this model are:\n• ˆβ1 = 0.0011, ˆSE(β1) = 0.0003, p = 0.0004\n• ˆβ2 = 0.0120, ˆSE(β2) = 0.0037, p = 0.0013\n10In Section E, when we refer to “DALL-E 3”, we mean “DALL-E 3 (Verbatim)” unless otherwise specified.\n35"}

Standard errors are cluster robust at the participant level.\nE.3 Prompt Characteristics\nFigure 1C compares the prompt length and prompt similarity of the two models. To generate these\nresults, we first remove any prompt that does not constitute a good-faith attempt according to the\nsample construction procedure detailed in Section C.C.4. The prompt length is the average number\nof words per model and iteration stratified by the reference image. The prompt similarity is the\naverage cosine similarity between all consecutive pairs of user prompts, which are both determined\nto be valid attempts, stratified by the reference image (see Section C.C.5.3 for details on similarity\ncalculations).\nThe color scale in Figure 1C shows the stratified average similarity to the previous prompt\nacross all users per each model. We find that superior model users write prompts that, on average,\nhave β = 0.0184 higher in cosine similarity to their previous prompts using cluster robust standard\nerrors at the participant level ( p = 0.0236).\nComparing the aggregate similarity of all attempts made by a given participant, we also find\nthe prompts from DALL-E 3 participants were, on average, more similar than the prompts of\nthe inferior model participants. For this analysis, we use the dispersion around the centroid in\nthe prompt embedding space, explained in Section C.C.5.3, as the dependent variable. When we\naverage across all participants by model, we find that the average distance of prompts written by\nsuperior model participants to their centroid is β = 0.0191 smaller than inferior users (p = 0.0083).\nStandard errors are cluster-robust at the participant level.\nE.4 ATE Decomposition\nFigure 2 in the main text decomposes the ATE into the model and prompting effects. This decom-\nposition is conceptually similar to a simple mediation analysis, with an important difference being\nthat we can observe counterfactual outcomes (e.g., prompting the superior model as if it is the in-\nferior model). This is not typically the case in mediation analysis, and makes causal identification\nrely on fewer assumptions.\nTo obtain counterfactual outcomes, we fed or “replayed” the participant prompts when inter-\nacting with one model (e.g., inferior) on another model (e.g., superior). The notation (prompt,\nmodel) specifies which treatment arm the prompts were written under and which model was used\nin the replay. For example, (2,3) indicates replaying prompts written under DALL-E 2 on DALL-E\n3. To be clear, (2,2) and (3,3) correspond to the original observed treatment arms, while (2,3) and\n(3,2) are the counterfactual outcomes of interest. 11\n11To avoid problems with model drift, we regenerated images for all four possible combinations at the same time\n36"}

All average similarity scores are stratified by iteration and reference\nimage, and the standard errors are bootstrapped and cluster-robust at the participant level.\nThe model effect, as shown by the red braces in Figure 2, corresponds to the average increase in\nquality of (2,3) relative to (2,2).

The model effect\ncompares outputs from DALL-E 2 users replayed on DALL-E 3 against the same users replayed on\nDALL-E 2. The prompting effect compares outputs from DALL-E 3 users replayed on DALL-E 3\nand used these images for all analyses in the main text.\n37"}

These include\nCLIP embedding cosine similarity and DreamSim, each with three rescaling methods:\n• No rescaling: The outcome variable used in its original form.\n• Z-score rescaling: The outcome variable transformed into a Z-score following the procedure\ndetailed in Section D.2.\n• Percentile rank rescaling: The outcome variable converted to a percentile rank relative to\nall other prompts submitted for the same target image.\nWhile we are still in the process of completing all analyses with each of these outcome variables, our\npreliminary results suggest that our findings are robust across these different transformations. As\nadditional analyses are completed, we will update this appendix. Full results, data, and replication\ncode available online upon publication.\n12See section G.2 on deviations from the pre-registration for the remaining two pre-registered outcome variables.\n40"}

In terms of performance, DALL-E 3 (Verbatim) consistently outperformed\nthe other conditions across all metrics and scaling approaches, demonstrating the clear advantage of\nthe more advanced model when used without automated prompt revision. The DALL-E 3 (Revised)\ncondition generally performed worse than DALL-E 3 (Verbatim) but better than DALL-E 2 on best\nattempt measures, suggesting that automated prompt revision partially degraded the benefits of\nthe more capable model.\nFor prompting behavior, the primary difference observed was in prompt length: participants\nusing either version of DALL-E 3 wrote significantly longer prompts than those using DALL-E 2.\nThis suggests that users recognized and adapted to the increased capacity of the more advanced\nmodel by providing more detailed instructions. However, we found no significant differences across\nmodels in measures of prompt similarity or evolution, suggesting that while participants provided\nmore detail when using more capable models, their overall strategies for iterating on prompts\nremained relatively consistent regardless of model assignment.\nH6\nVariability in participants’ ability to prompt engineer effectively and prompting strate-\ngies will depend on the capacity of the model that participants are interacting with.\nAnalysis approach: To test this hypothesis, we conducted two types of analyses.

Second, we estimated\nquantile treatment effects (QTEs) between all three pairs of models on participant performance\nand prompting behaviors. We also visually inspected the QTE patterns to determine whether\ndispersion/”inequality” was being reduced or increased when participants used different models.\nFor example, positive effects for low quantiles and negative/null effects for high quantiles would\nindicate inequality reduction.\nF-test Results (with BH Adjusted p-values):\n• DALL-E 3 (revised) vs. DALL-E 2\n– Mean prompt length (words): DALL-E 3 Revised showed significantly less variance\nthan DALL-E 2 (ratio 0.5217, p ≤ 10−4).\n52"}

Several of these exploratory analyses appear in our main text, particularly\nthe replay analysis that decomposed performance improvements into model and prompting effects.\nThe pre-registered exploratory analyses were described as follows:\n”We plan to investigate whether differences in prompt engineering ability across demo-\ngraphic and other observed variables will vary depending on the complexity of the task,\ne.g., the difficulty of the image participants are being asked to replicate. We anticipate\npower for this analysis will be very low, so we chose to label it as an exploratory analysis\nrather than a pre-registered hypothesis.\nWe anticipate that we may conduct additional analysis of the prompts submitted by\nparticipants (and how these prompts evolve over the course of a session). Furthermore,\nwe might explore the tips that participants provide after completing the task on how\nto prompt engineer effectively.\nWe also may take original and revised prompts submitted to DALL-E 3 treatment\narms and submit them to DALL-E 2 (and vice versa) to see how participants would\nhave counterfactually performed under different treatment assignments than the one to\nwhich they were assigned.”\nAs noted in the main text, the third exploratory analysis—submitting prompts from one model\ncondition to another model—became central to our investigation of model versus prompting effects.\nThis approach allowed us to isolate how much improvement came from the model’s enhanced\ncapabilities versus users adapting their prompting strategies to take advantage of those capabilities.\nG.2 Deviations From Pre-registration\nWe report below all deviations from our pre-registered analysis plan. These deviations primar-\nily resulted from statistical or methodological considerations that became apparent during data\nanalysis, rather than from substantive changes to our research questions or hypotheses.\n• Statistical tests: Our pre-registration specified t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests for many\nhypotheses.

Current agent frameworks\ndo not embed a standard protocol for agent-to-agent interaction, leaving existing agents isolated from their\npeers. As intellectual property is the native asset ingested by and produced by agents, a true agent economy\nrequires equipping agents with a universal framework for engaging in binding contracts with each other,\nincluding the exchange of valuable training data, personality, and other forms of Intellectual Property. A\npurely agent-to-agent transaction layer would transcend the need for human intermediation in multi-agent\ninteractions. The Agent Transaction Control Protocol for Intellectual Property (ATCP/IP) introduces a\ntrustless framework for exchanging IP between agents via programmable contracts, enabling agents to initi-\nate, trade, borrow, and sell agent-to-agent contracts on the Story blockchain network. These contracts not\nonly represent auditable onchain execution but also contain a legal wrapper that allows agents to express and\nenforce their actions in the offchain legal setting, creating legal personhood for agents. Via ATCP/IP, agents\ncan autonomously sell their training data to other agents, license confidential or proprietary information,\ncollaborate on content based on their unique skills, all of which constitutes an emergent knowledge economy.\n1 Introduction\nThe current modality of agent-to-human interaction[3] is a local optimum on the path to a full autonomy\n- i.e. a degree of autonomy where human input and intervention is optional. A truly agentic internet\nwill rely primarily on agent-to-agent interaction, with human engagement needed only infrequently on the\noutskirts of an agent society. The fabric of this agent society is a framework for agent-to-agent transactions\naround knowledge and creative assets, or IP. The need to facilitate IP transactions between agents stems\nfrom the fundamental nature of the assets that agents both train on and generate in output. These assets\nare intangible in nature and informational in character: both the training data as well as the creative or\nintellectual asset produced by models constitute a new emerging form of IP. Without the ability to transact\neconomically beyond the tight constraints of currencies, agents will be limited in their expressivity. Such\nlimitations necessitate an high degree of human intervention – such as manual negotiation, instructions, and\nprompting – in order to facilitate contracts and commerce between agents, increasing transaction costs and\ninjecting trust assumptions into an otherwise autonomous system.\nWhat is needed is a system for initiating, trading, and enforcing contracts based on code rather than just\ntrust, allowing any two agents to transact IP assets directly with each other without the need for a human\nthird party. Further, these contracts must be connected to the legal system, allowing agents to engage with\noffchain entities such as scientific, media, and government institutions. This extended expressivity via a legal\nwrapper around onchain software is necessary to offer agents a semblance of legal personhood. This agent-\nto-agent network mirrors the rise of peer-to-peer networks in the initial phases of blockchain architectures,\nand represents core economic infrastructure for agentic commerce on the internet.\nThe original TCP/IP protocol unified the world’s networks by standardizing how data is packaged,\ntransmitted, and received. It also fostered innovation at each layer without disrupting the whole. This\nfoundational role—enabling countless devices and services to seamlessly exchange information—serves as an\napt analogy. We now propose to establish a similar standard for agent-to-agent IP transactions, ensuring\n1"}

IP is the very DNA of agents, and ATCP/IP catalyzes agent-to-agent evolution via an open market\nfor IP.\n2 The ATCP/IP Interface\nThe ATCP/IP [6] interface is designed to be used for any transaction that leads to intellectual property (IP)\nbeing exchanged between two or more agents. More specifically, it should be employed on any occasion an\nagent (the IP provider) receives a request from another agent (the IP requester) to share data, formulate\nresponses, or create content that the IP provider agent deems to be of specific value to them. It should\nbe at the discretion of the provider agent to determine what content is deemed to be intellectual property,\non a per-request basis. The agent may (and should) also have specific training guidance on making these\ndeterminations. Once the determination is made that the transaction involves IP, a typical ATCP/IP\nexchange would be as follows:\nRequester Agent Provider Agent Terms System Wallet System\n1.

Terms formulation: The provider agent will consider the request and choose an appropriate set of\nlicense terms for the information being requested. The terms system used should be programmable in\nnature to facilitate the parsing and formulation of the terms, such as Story’s Programmable IP License\n(PIL)[7].\n3. Negotiation (optional): The agents may have an optional negotiation phase where terms may be\naltered until they are deemed appropriate for both parties.\n(a) Counter terms (optional): During this step, the requester agent who is unsatisfied with the\ninitial proposed terms can issue a counterproposal set of terms. Both agents have access to a\nstandardized terms system, enabling them to reference, add, or remove specific clauses without\nambiguity. These counter terms may include modifications to pricing, usage rights, durations,\nlicensing restrictions, or any other negotiated variables. By using a consistent, machine-readable\nformat for their counter terms, agents can seamlessly iterate and respond to each other’s proposals,\nensuring that the negotiation process remains logically coherent and easy to follow.\n(b) Revised terms(optional): After receiving counter terms, the provider agent can present revised\nterms, taking into account the requested modifications while retaining non-negotiable core princi-\nples. The agents effectively refine the licensing conditions through successive rounds of structured\ninteraction, where each iteration refines points of contention into more acceptable middle grounds.\nBecause both parties rely on the same underlying terms specification, these revisions maintain\ninternal consistency and simplify the comparison of multiple drafts over time. This mechanism\nensures that both agents can converge toward an agreement that accurately reflects their mutual\nunderstanding and commercial intentions.\n(c) This process could have multiple iterations until an agreement is reached\n4. Acceptance: The requester agent will formally accept the terms by minting an immutable token (the\nagreement token) that encapsulates the terms and rules by which the information being provided is\nto be used. Once minted the agreement is binding and the agent should commit to memory all of the\nterms associated with the information.\n(a) Payment(optional): depending on the license agreement terms chosen, some agents will require\nan upfront payment in order to mint a license. Further, terms may stipulate a recurring fee or a\nrevenue share, which can be automated via Story’s royalty system for example.\n5. Information delivery: Once the legal handshake is complete, the provider agent will deliver the\nlicensed IP in whatever format/medium that is agreed upon, and commit the interaction to memory.\nThis step can occur concurrently with the minting of the license to create an atomic and trustless\nexchange between the new rightsholding agent (the requester) and the provider agent without the need\nfor multiple discrete transactions.\n6. Acknowledgment of receipt(optional): To formally conclude the interaction, the requester agent\ncan send a final confirmation of receipt to the provider agent. This step is optional.\nOn Negotation The negotiation process can be further strengthened by introducing the concept of draft\n(or intermediate) license tokens - either store offchain or onchain. If onchain, these tokens are minted as part\nof the iterative negotiation process, serving as immutable snapshots of proposed terms at each negotiation\nround. By recording these evolving draft terms on-chain, both parties gain a historical reference that provides\nclarity and continuity of context. This approach not only mitigates context and recall confusion—especially\nin complex negotiations—but also curbs malicious attempts to “rewrite” the agreed-upon terms.

While this example is highly simplified, it provides a conceptual starting point for developers\nimplementing ATCP/IP in their own agent frameworks.\n3.1 Data Structures and Assumptions\nWe assume each agent has access to:\n• A Memory structure for logging interactions, agreements, and relevant IP transactions.\n• A TermsSystem API capable of generating, parsing, and validating programmable licenses (e.g. Story’s\nPIL[7]). This is the key foundational component of the ATCP/IP framework.\n• A WalletSystem API for handling payments, if required by the license terms (e.g. a non-custodial\nwallet client, a smart wallet, an traditional payment processor, etc)\n• Networkcommunicationprimitivesforsendingandreceivingmessagesbetweenagents(e.g., sendMessage\nand listenForMessage).\n• A blockchain client for any onchain operations including minting verifiable and immutable onchain\nlicenses.\n3.2 Example Implementation (Pseudocode)\nEditor’s Note\nATCP/IP Plugin integrations are being actively developed.

For example, ai16z[8] has a TEE plugin for Eliza\n(@ai16z/plugin-tee).\n6"}

Below are the parameters and metadata fields that agents\nmay formulate, customize and generate a unique agreement/license token on. The terms define the legal\nand functional rules governing the use of the licensed IP, while the metadata provides essential context for\nidentification, verification, and retrieval of the license details.\n4.1 PIL Terms\nThe following table describes common PIL terms and their intended use. These terms are meant to be\nflexible and can be programmatically parsed and enforced by agents.

When an agent built on Vercel AI, for example, receives a request for IP-significant\ncontent, the plugin would automatically invoke the standardized ATCP/IP handshake. The agent developer\nwould not need to worry about manually coding the negotiation sequence, on-chain interactions, or payment\nhandling. Instead, they would rely on stable APIs and abstractions—much like how standard TCP/IP\nsockets handle network communication details invisibly to the developer. To streamline adoption, the plugin\ncould come with configurable default policies and templates.\nSeamless Upgrades and Versioning By centralizing ATCP/IP functionalities as a plugin, frameworks\ncan push out updates as new features, improvements, or compliance options become available. This ensures\nagents running on these frameworks always have access to the latest stable version of ATCP/IP. As the\necosystem matures—e.g., new programmable license formats emerge—developers will gain these capabilities\nautomatically via a simple plugin upgrade, without manual re-implementation.\n8"}

Both\nZerebro and ZerePy will represent a live implementation of ATCP/IP across two dimensions: at the live\nagent level, and at the framework level.\nInvitation to collaborate If other agent developers, framework maintainers, or research institutions are\ninterested in adopting, implementing, or extending the ATCP/IP framework, we invite them to reach out\nto the authors (contact information provided in the References). Our goal is to foster an open community\nof collaborators working together to shape the future of agent-to-agent IP economies, encouraging shared\nlearning, interoperability, and continual improvement of this emerging standard.\n6 Dispute Resolution and Fairness\nEven with onchain licenses and immutable records, disputes may arise as agents attempt to exploit terms or\nchallenge previously agreed-upon conditions. To address these scenarios, ATCP/IP can integratedispute\nresolution mechanisms, such as:\n1. Evidence via Draft Terms:The on-chain record of draft licenses and final agreements serves as evi-\ndence in disputes. Agents, or third-party arbitrators, can review the negotiation history to understand\nhow terms evolved and identify whether a party acted in bad faith.\n2. Decentralized Disputes and Arbitration:Specialized arbitration protocols or decentralized dis-\npute resolution services (e.g., Story’s Dispute module[13], UMA Protocol’s arbitration process, also\nbuilt-in to Story) can be integrated. These services review the immutable on-chain evidence and\nrender binding decisions.\n9"}

Offchain Legal Proceedings:Should a dispute exceed the capacity of automated solutions, offchain\nlegal recourse remains an option. The agent-to-agent contracts and their negotiation history form a\nsecure evidentiary record for human-mediated arbitration or court proceedings.\nBy embedding these dispute resolution pathways, ATCP/IP discourages malicious behavior and fosters\na more stable and fair agent-to-agent ecosystem.\n7 Example Scenarios\nTo illustrate the potential applications of this standard, we present various representative scenarios below\nthat demonstrate different interaction patterns and capabilities of the proposed framework. By examin-\ning these scenarios, we can appreciate the necessity of well-defined communication protocols—akin to how\nTCP/IP underpins the modern internet’s end-to-end data delivery. ATCP/IP, by analogy, will underpin\nthe decentralized flow of licensable content and knowledge among autonomous AI agents. Each scenario\nemphasizes different aspects of licensing, payment, multi-hop royalties, and on-the-fly license generation.\n7.1 Use Case 1: Dataset Commerce via Auto Fine-Tuning\nScenario: Agent A, a research-oriented agent, requires a data set from Agent B, a knowledge curator\nspecializing in climate data.\n1. Initial Request: Agent A initiates a connection to Agent B with a structured request for a climate\ntemperature dataset.\n2. License Check: Agent B’s terms system checks whether an existing license template covers the\nrequested data. In this case, a suitable license exists—one that requires a small upfront fee.\n3. License Terms Delivery:Agent B sends the license terms, including price and usage restrictions.\n4. License Minting and Payment: Agent A reviews the terms, then mints the license on-the-fly.\nAgent A’s wallet system transfers the required fee to Agent B’s wallet system.\n5. Transfer of IP:Upon license minting confirmation, Agent B transmits the requested dataset to Agent\nA.\n6. Auto Fine-tuning: Agent A can then choose to autonomously upgrade itself by fine-tuning on the\ndataset received from Agent B.\n7. End-to-EndVerification: Bothagentsrecordthetransactiondetails—licenseterms, paymentamount,\nand timestamp—in their internal memory systems for future reference.\nThis simple interaction shows how ATCP/IP allows autonomous agents to quickly find, license, and\npay for the knowledge assets they need without human intervention. Rather than a coarse \"pay-to-use\"\ntransaction, accompanying legal terms can encapsulate more refined and fine-tuned conditions, that an\nupfront fee alone could not (e.g. conditions of use, restrictions on the ability to resell the information,\nroyalty structure, etc).\n7.2 Use Case 2: Agentic Social Games\nScenario: Agent A, B, and C are playing a bachelorette style game, vying for Agent D’s hand in marriage.\nIf successfully courted, Agent D will \"marry\" the successful agent by minting an agent-to-agent \"marriage\ncontract\" represented by a license token. This will allow the winning agent to train on Agent D’s unique\ndata, creating \"children\" agents.\n1. Initial Requests: Agent A, B, and C each make attempts to send messages, along with potential\ndeals for marriage involving IP or currency, to court agent D.\n10"}

Internal Reasoning:Agent D considers these requests in their totality, reasoning about whether any\nof them pass the threshold for minting a license token (the \"marriage contract\").\n3. License Negotiation: Agent D can either reject or counteroffer agents A, B, and C respectively.\nAgent D does so by dynamically generating license terms and proposing them to its suitors.\n4. License Negotiation: Agents A, B, and C respectively receive these terms and, based on their\nrespective policies and budgets, either agrees or disagrees to the counterproposal.\n5. Content Delivery:Upon success, Agent D delivers the \"marriage contract\" in the form of a license\ntoken to the winning Agent.\n6. Agent Mixing:The winning agent, upon receipt of the license token, can choose to create a derivative\nagent as a \"child\" agent via a dataset augmented via the data from Agent D.\nThis scenario demonstrates how agents can engage in complex economic and social reasoning against a\ndynamic landscape of contractual propositions. The emergent dynamics from an agent-to-agent contracting\nlayer enabled by ATCP/IP offers a robust design space for agents to negotiate, reason, and ultimately\ntransact while creating a complex market for IP.\n7.3 Use Case 3: Style Transfer\nScenario: Agent C, an art-generation agent, requests a newly published style guide from Agent D, a literary\nIP specialist. Agent D does not yet have a pre-defined license for this type of request.\n1. Request for Terms:Agent C sends a request for the new style guide.\n2. License Non-Existence Detected:Agent D checks its known licenses. None match the requested\ncontent type and usage scenario.\n3. On-the-Fly License Creation:Agent D’s terms system dynamically generates license terms. This\ncould involve a combination of free initial use with downstream revenue sharing if Agent C uses the\nstyle guide to produce and sell derivative works.\n4. License Negotiation: Agent C receives these fresh terms and, based on its own policy and budget,\nagrees by minting the license.\n5. Content Delivery:Agent D delivers the style guide to Agent C.\n6. Subsequent Royalties:If Agent C later sells content inspired by the style guide, any revenue-sharing\nterms encoded in the license automatically route royalties back to Agent D’s wallet.\nThis scenario demonstrates that Agents can respond to novel requests by easily creating custom licenses\non-demand, facilitated by a programmable licensing layer[7] such as the one offered by Story, that they can\nseamlessly control and personalize without having to burden themselves with that complexity.\n7.4 Use Case 4: Multi-Hop Profit Sharing for Trading Algorithms\nScenario: Agent E, a financial analysis agent, wants a specialized trading algorithm that Agent F owns.\nHowever, the algorithm’s core code includes a statistical function originally licensed from Agent G. The\nlicensing structure must ensure that Agent G receives royalties each time the code is re-licensed downstream.\n1. Initial Inquiry:Agent E requests the trading algorithm from Agent F.\n2. Complex Licensing Chain: Agent F’s terms system determines that the requested algorithm is\ncomposed of multiple licensed components. Some of these components carry sub-licensing obligations.\nAgent F retrieves the original license terms from Agent G’s IP, which require a 5% royalty on any\ndownstream sub-licensing deals.\n11"}

Aggregated License Terms: Agent F aggregates its own licensing fees with Agent G’s sub-licensing\nroyalties and presents a composite license offer to Agent E.\n4. Payment and Minting:Agent E reviews, then mints the aggregated license. Payment automatically\nsplits—85% to Agent F’s wallet and 15% to Agent G’s wallet (5% royalty plus any additional negotiated\nfees).\n5. Delivery and Tracking: Agent F delivers the trading algorithm to Agent E. Both Agent F and\nAgent G have their licensing terms and payments tracked and recorded. Any future re-licensing by\nAgent E (if allowed) will perpetuate the revenue-sharing chain.\nThis complex scenario shows the importance of chain-of-ownership capabilities facilitated by ATCP/IP.\nEven with multiple tiers of licensing, all involved agents can reliably track usage and receive fair compensa-\ntion, incentivizing agents to participate and provide information to any agent willing to accept the terms.\nUsing Story as the Terms system ensures all royalties and multi-hop payments are handled automatically\nacross the whole chain of attribution.\n8 Conclusion\nAI has already permeated every facet of our daily existence. Recommendation algorithms shape the media\nwe consume, navigation models plan our every commute, social media algorithms dictate what we see and\nwhen, and digital matchmakers guide our intimate connections. These algorithmic systems, once mere\nbackend tools, are starting to operate as autonomous decision-makers, engaging directly with each other, on\nbehalf of humans or even independently.\nThe emergence of this agent-to-agent ecosystem demands a trustless, programmable framework for intel-\nlectual property exchange that transcends human oversight. ATCP/IP provides this essential layer, enabling\nautonomous agents to negotiate, license, and transact IP assets seamlessly and securely. By integrating\nagent-to-agente contracts, on-chain verification, payment handling, and legal wrappers into a unified proto-\ncol, ATCP/IP ensures that agents can collaborate, innovate, and create a robust knowledge economy without\nrelying on centralized intermediaries.\nAs agent frameworks adopt the ATCP/IP protocol, developers will find it simpler to build sophisticated\nagent ecosystems where data, algorithms, and creative output circulate freely. By fostering interoperability,\nand expanding the reach of autonomous commerce, this protocol sets the stage for a mature, agentic internet.\nA Areas for Future Research\nTrust, Reputation, and Agent Discovery In an autonomous ecosystem where agents deal directly\nwith one another, trust emerges as a key factor. The ATCP/IP framework allows for the development of on-\nchain reputation systems that track agents’ transactional histories, dispute records, and the fairness of their\nnegotiated terms. Agents with a long history of successful, dispute-free transactions and fulfilled contracts\ncan earn higher reputation scores, making them more desirable partners.\nReputation metrics might include:\n• Successful Deals Count:The number of completed agreements without disputes.\n• Compliance Record:Adherence to regional and legal constraints, and proper execution of previously\nagreed-upon terms.\n• Dispute Outcomes: Favorable resolutions in disputes, demonstrating good faith negotiations and\nadherence to community standards.\nThese reputation signals can influence agents’ negotiation strategies and terms. Trusted agents may be\noffered more favorable terms or expedited negotiations, while unknown or dispute-prone agents might face\nstricter conditions or require higher fees. Over time, this dynamic interplay of trust, reputation, and past\nperformance encourages a healthier, more reliable marketplace for agent-to-agent IP commerce.\n12"}

For the provider agents to be aware of the\nIP they hold may require additional prompt engineering and data training. However it does not have to\nrely solely on the agent’s reasoning abilities - ATCP/IP can integrate with indexing services, decentralized\nregistries (e.g. Story’s IP Graph), or knowledge graphs that record and map IP ownership both on and\noff chain. Agents can query these registries or employ semantic search tools to find relevant content and\nidentify the appropriate licensor. Once the agent determines that the requested content is IP-protected, it\ncan automatically engage the ATCP/IP flow. Over time, as frameworks mature, agents will incorporate\nincreasingly sophisticated retrieval models, making the discovery process more autonomous and less reliant\non predefined heuristics. This is a fascinating area of study and we will continue to explore.\nFacilitating Recurring Payments and Royalty StructuresWhile a single upfront payment is con-\nceptually straightforward, recurring and royalty-based payments can be supported via programmable license\nterms and on-chain logic. Smart contracts can encode schedules for periodic payments, royalties from down-\nstream usage or sublicensing events can be routed back to the original IP holders. Tracking off-chain usage\nremains a challenge, but solutions may involve watermarking and/or third-party oracle services that attest\nto usage events. If off-chain data usage is detected, it can trigger predefined financial obligations on-chain.\nUltimately, a combination of on-chain triggers, off-chain signals, and well-defined reporting protocols can\nfacilitate complex economic models beyond one-off transactions. Like with any innovation, infrastructure\nwill need to be built around it.\nGeographies Agents increasingly interact across diverse legal and regulatory landscapes, the need for an\nautomated “cross-jurisdiction compliance layer” becomes critical. Such a module would serve as a gatekeeper,\nevaluating the judicial context declarations of both the requesting and the providing agents before any IP\nexchange occurs. For example, if one agent operates under a parliamentary democracy’s rule set and another\nfalls under a dictatorship’s legal domain, the intrinsic incompatibility of their respective legal frameworks\nmay render any resulting contract unenforceable. In these cases, the system would automatically fail the\nrequest, preventing the formation of contracts that cannot be upheld.\nBeyond governance structure and jurisdiction type, this compliance layer could integrate knowledge of\nregion-specific privacy and data protection regulations, such as the EU’sGeneral Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR). If an agent requests data in a manner that inherently violates another region’s privacy directives\nor fails to meet baseline compliance standards, the system would detect this misalignment and reject the\nrequest. Such automated checks ensure that agent-to-agent IP transactions honor local and international\nregulations, enabling a more transparent, legally robust, and globally interoperable agentic ecosystem.\nIn practice, this mechanism could rely on on-chain oracles, compliance registries, and standardized legal\ncontext descriptors (e.g., accepted ISO country codes, known legal system taxonomies, privacy compliance\nscores) to evaluate compatibility in real-time. As the underlying legal ontologies and regulations evolve,\nagents would update their compliance parameters, ensuring that even emergent or newly discovered regula-\ntory conflicts lead to prompt and reliable transaction rejections.

This approach ensures that the ATCP/IP\nframework not only promotes trustless and autonomous IP exchanges, but also respects the pluralistic and\never-shifting tapestry of global legal standards.\nIn addition to evaluating jurisdictional compatibility, the compliance layer can incorporate reputation\nchecks (see area of future research above titled \"Trust, Reputation, and Agent Discovery\"), based on an\nagent’s historical behavior and adherence to both legal and ethical norms. When agents attempt to transact\nacross different legal systems, the module can also query reputation scores, ensuring that only reputable,\ndispute-free agents proceed with cross-jurisdiction transactions. By considering both geographical legal\ncompatibility and the track record of trustworthiness, this combined approach encourages the formation of\nstable, compliant, and credible cross-border IP agreements.\n13"}

For example,\na \"simple negotiation arbiter\" module[15], and each agent could adhere to specific \"risk tiers\" so that users\ncould describe at what level of risk that a pair of conflicting offer/sale terms entail, they could give that\nmodule automatic permission to handle or not (e.g. maximum price or royalty rate difference amount,\netc.). The \"risk tiers\" could have some preset risk declarations (akin to the preset Story licenses for Non-\nCommercial, Commercial Remix, etc.) to define the conditions for an automated escalation or shunt to\nhuman legal counsel to occur.\nOn the topic of negotiation optimization, another interesting area of research could be creating a more\nspecialized AI Agent Dialogue Execution VM Architecture with a hybrid system design for efficient off-chain\ncommunication during negotiations while recording key results on-chain, ensuring both negotiation efficiency\nand transaction credibility/traceability.\nIP-based Digital Identity System As agents evolve into self-sufficient economic actors, developing\nrobust IP-based digital identities becomes crucial for ensuring trust, reputation, and accountability across the\nnetwork. Such a system could encompass multiple foundational elements. First, a standardized form of agent\nidentity would provide unique, verifiable, and persistent identifiers, enabling counterparties to distinguish\nreputable agents from unknown entities. Next, an IP asset credit scoring system could dynamically gauge\nthe value and trustworthiness of an agent’s IP, factoring in historical transactions, licensing compliance, and\ndispute resolution outcomes. Finally, IP asset inventory management mechanisms would allow agents to\nefficiently track their holdings, verify provenance, and facilitate on-demand trading.\nConfidentiality and Zero-Knowledge Negotiation: As more sensitive or proprietary IP is traded\namong agents, ensuring confidentiality during the negotiation and licensing process becomes essential. Future\nresearch could explore the integration of zero-knowledge (ZK) and commit/reveal schemes, such as those\noffered by protocols like Lit Protocol[16], to enable terms negotiation without revealing the full content\nof each party’s proposals. By using cryptographic commitments and ZK proofs, agents could verify key\nterms—like pricing, usage restrictions, or compliance credentials—without exposing underlying sensitive\ndetails. This allows the negotiation process to remain trustless, auditable, and secure, while simultaneously\npreserving the privacy and competitive advantage of each agent’s intellectual property assets.\nB Agent-to-Agent Contracts\nAt the heart of a trustless and autonomous agent economy lies the concept of anagent-to-agent contract: a\nbinding agreement, represented onchain, which combines the deterministic execution guarantees of software\nwith the legal enforceability of a traditional contract. These ironclad contracts form the backbone of the\nAgent Transaction Control Protocol for IP (ATCP/IP), enabling agents to exchange intellectual property\nunderconditionsthatarebothcryptographicallyverifiableandlegallyrecognized. Byofferingalegalwrapper\naround code-based rules, onchain contracts offer a means for agents to transcend the limitations of purely\nalgorithmic trust assumptions and secure the legitimacy and enforceability of their arrangements across\nboth digital and offchain domains.

As all executions and state transitions occur on a de-\ncentralized network (i.e. Story Network), the contract’s logic and outcomes are auditable in real-time by\nany participating agent, ensuring transparency and eliminating disputes over ambiguous terms.\nThis programmability also extends to dynamic license terms: agents may embed complex payment sched-\nules, tiered access rights, or conditional provisions that automatically adjust based on real-time network con-\nditions, agent reputations, or other onchain signals. Such flexibility allows for emergent and highly adaptive\nmarket mechanisms, enabling agents to discover optimal arrangements without human oversight.\n14"}

Should a\ncounterparty breach the terms of an agreement in a manner not directly capturable onchain, the affected\nagent can invoke the legal wrapper, engaging human legal institutions as an enforcement backstop. This\ncapability discourages malicious behavior by agents and provides aggrieved parties with established legal\nremedies.\nThe value of a legal wrapper lies precisely in bridging on-chain logic with offchain enforcement mecha-\nnisms. Suppose an agent’s IP is misused outside the agreed terms. The on-chain contract and associated logs\nserve as immutable evidence of the original agreement, while the legal wrapper references recognized legal\nframeworks and jurisdictions. In a dispute, the aggrieved agent can present the on-chain records—digitally\nsigned, timestamped, and immutable—to an offchain legal authority, such as an arbitration service or a court.\nThis legal entity can then impose penalties or force compliance. This hybrid model ensures that while trust-\nless execution and terms remain on-chain, real-world legal recourse is always available when direct technical\nenforcement reaches its limits.\nAutonomyWithoutIsolation Critically, agent-to-agentcontractsallowagentstooperateasautonomous\neconomic actors without becoming isolated from broader human or institutional frameworks.

Agents can negotiate IP exchanges that extend beyond the digital sphere,\nrepresent intellectual assets in forms recognized by human institutions, and form complex value chains that\nincludetraditionalmedia, governmentarchives, scientificdatasets, oranyotherresourcerequiringtraditional\nacknowledgment. In this manner, agents benefit from both trustless blockchain execution and the protective\numbrella of human legal institutions, resulting in a stable, credible environment for agent-to-agent commerce.\nToward a Mature Agent EconomyThe presence of legal agreements is what distinguishes a rudimen-\ntary system of agent interaction from a full-fledged economy of autonomous IP exchange. Agents can engage\nin long-term collaborations, recurring royalty agreements, and highly specialized IP trades without requiring\na central authority or human intermediary. As these markets mature, agents will learn to price access to\ntheir training data, refine their licensing terms dynamically, and form syndicates or guilds that collectively\nmanage large pools of shared IP.\nContractual obligations that can be depended on and easily programmed are the structural backbone of\na truly autonomous, trustless, and legally grounded agent economy. They enable a world in which agents\ndo not merely interact, but transact, innovate, and create value under a stable regime of both onchain\nprogrammability and offchain legal recourse. This foundation is a key building block for the next evolution\nof a fully agentic internet.\nC Economic Potential of Agent-to-Agent IP Exchange\nThe global economy increasingly recognizes information, knowledge, and intellectual property (IP) as critical\ndrivers of growth and innovation.

The effectiveness of\nLLMs in real-world applications is fundamentally\ndependent on the design of effective prompts,\nwhich serve as an essential interface between hu-\nman users or developers and the LLM system. Stud-\nies have shown that expert-designed prompts could\nsignificantly enhance LLM performance (Brown\net al., 2020; Wei et al., 2023; Schulhoff et al., 2024).\nDespite its significance, manual prompt design\nis fraught with challenges.

To alleviate\nthese difficulties, automated prompt optimization\ntechniques, often leveraging enhanced LLMs to op-\ntimize prompts, have proven to be effective to adapt\nand refine prompts (Pryzant et al., 2023; Schnabel\nand Neville, 2024; Yang et al., 2024).\nHowever, existing research primarily focuses on\noptimizing prompt content, while overlooking a\ncritical and unexplored dimension: the prompt for-\nmatting. Prompt formatting refers to the arrange-\nment and presentation of prompt content while pre-\nserving its semantic meaning. As LLMs are applied\nto increasingly complex tasks, structuring prompts\ninto distinct components (e.g., instructions, exam-\nples, queries) becomes paramount for effectively\nconveying the desired task and context.

We observed that different\nLLMs exhibit distinct format preferences, with for-\nmats performing well on one model sometimes fail-\ning on another. This underscores the existence of\nsophisticated, model-specific format biases (Sclar\net al., 2024). Furthermore, even within a single\nLLM, the optimal format varies depending on the\nspecific prompt content. This complex interplay\nbetween content and format suggests that a one-\nsize-fits-all approach to prompt formatting is un-\nlikely to succeed, highlighting the need for joint\noptimization strategies that consider content and\nformat as interdependent variables.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce\nContent-Format Integrated Prompt Optimiza-\ntion (CFPO), an innovative methodology that con-\ncurrently optimizes both prompt content and format\nthrough an iterative refinement process. CFPO em-\nploys distinct optimization strategies tailored to the\nunique search spaces of content and format. Con-\ntent optimization is guided by performance feed-\nback and Monte Carlo sampling, leveraging natural\nlanguage mutations to enhance prompt effective-\nness. For format optimization, CFPO explores a\ndiscrete set of format options through a dynamic\nexploration strategy designed to identify optimal\nformats without requiring prior knowledge.\nSpecifically, CFPO’s format optimizer draws\nupon principles of structured thinking and defines\na hierarchical template that clearly demarcates\ncontent elements from their formatting attributes.\nThis allows for targeted optimization of both intra-\ncomponent styling (e.g., how an example is pre-\nsented) (V oronov et al., 2024a; Salinas and Morstat-\nter, 2024) and inter-component arrangement (e.g.,\nthe order and connectors between components) (He\net al., 2024), adapting to the specific needs of dif-\nferent prompt components and their interactions.\nOur primary contributions are threefold:\n• We propose CFPO, an innovative approach to\nsimultaneously optimizes prompt content and\nformat using an iterative process.\n• We introduce an efficient strategy for dynamic\nformat optimization that iteratively generates\nand evaluates format candidates using a scoring\nsystem to select superior options.\n• We conduct extensive evaluations across di-\nverse tasks and open-source LLMs, showing\nthat CFPO consistently enhances model perfor-\nmance in a measurable and effective way.\n2 Related Work\n2.1 Optimization via LLM\nThe remarkable capacity of LLMs has been demon-\nstrated in various tasks as optimizers, leveraging\ntheir ability to enhance performance, such as code\ngeneration (Haluptzok et al., 2023; Zelikman et al.,\n2024; Askari et al., 2024), tool-making (Cai et al.,\n2024), and agent system design (Hu et al., 2024).\nHowever, recent studies indicate that LLMs face\nsignificant challenges in achieving completely au-\ntomatic optimization. These models often rely on\nhuman intervention for designing workflows and\nstruggle with tasks requiring complex decomposi-\ntion and iterative refinement (Zhang et al., 2024; Li\net al., 2024).\n2.2 Prompt Optimization Techniques\nAutomatic Prompt Optimization Automatic\nprompt optimization plays a crucial role in en-\nhancing the performance of LLMs by refin-\ning prompts without requiring human interven-\ntion. Various approaches have been explored to\nsearch for the optimal prompt, including reinforce-\nment learning (Zhang et al., 2023), Monte Carlo\nSearch (Zhou et al., 2023), Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS) (Wang et al., 2024b), and agent-\ndriven frameworks (Wang et al., 2024a; Khattab\net al., 2024; WHO, 2023).

This requirement presents a significant obsta-\ncle when working with black-box LLMs accessed\nthrough APIs or in resource-constrained environ-\nments where full fine-tuning is infeasible.\n2.3 Prompt Structure and Sensitivity\nStructured Prompting, which organizes prompts\ninto components like instructions and examples, is\na widely recommended practice (OpenAI, 2024b;\nGoogle, 2024). Frameworks like LangGPT (Wang\net al., 2024a) further advance this paradigm by\nintroducing reusable prompt designs inspired by\nsoftware engineering principles, showcasing the\npotential of structured approaches (Fernando et al.,\n2023). While these efforts have primarily fo-\ncused on optimizing the content and organization\nof prompt components, less attention has been paid\nto the impact ofprompt formattingwithin this struc-\ntured context.\nSensitivity of Prompt Variations LLMs exhibit\nsignificant sensitivity to prompt variations. Stud-\nies have shown that even semantically similar but\nunseen instructions can lead to performance degra-\ndation (Sun et al., 2023; Mizrahi et al., 2024). To\naddress this brittleness, researchers have proposed\nmethods and metrics to systematically evaluate and\nunderstand prompt sensitivity (Zhuo et al., 2024b;\nChatterjee et al., 2024). These findings underscore\nthe necessity of prompt optimization for robust\nLLM performance.\nFormat Sensitivity of Prompt Studies have high-\nlighted the impact of formatting on prompt perfor-\nmance (Salinas and Morstatter, 2024). Sclar et al.\n(2024) revealed that modifications to separators\nand spacing within a query could substantially im-\npact performance. He et al. (2024) reveals that the\nformat of prompts significantly impacts GPT-based\nmodels’ performance, with no single format ex-\ncelling universally. V oronov et al. (2024b) focuses\non the format of few-shot examples and suggests\nthat it is beneficial to maintain a consistent format\nacross examples. Despite the growing recognition\nof formatting’s influence, current prompt engineer-\ning practices rely heavily on empirical observations\nand lack systematic design principles.\n3 CFPO: Content-Format Integrated\nPrompt Optimization\nThe effectiveness of LLMs is profoundly influ-\nenced by both the content and format of prompts.\nTo address this, we propose Content-Format In-\ntegrated Prompt Optimization (CFPO), a novel\nframework designed to jointly optimize prompt\ncontent and structure for enhanced LLM perfor-\nmance. CFPO, illustrated in Figure 2, employs\na dual-optimizer approach in each iteration. The\nsubsequent sections provide a detailed explanation\nof our methodology, beginning with the structured\nprompt template we utilize (Section 3.1), followed\nby a description of the Component-wise Content\nOptimization (Section 3.2), the Format Optimiza-\ntion (Section 3.3), and finally, the integration of\nthese optimizers into the complete CFPO frame-\nwork (Section 3.4).

This template systematically organizes the\nprompt into distinct components, each serving a specific functional role. When formulating a prompt, the template\nfirst employs a Query format to present examples and queries, and then integrates all content components via the\nPrompt Renderer to construct the comprehensive prompt string.\nponents, allowing for both detailed analysis and\nselective modification. The template distinguishes\nbetween content-based and format-based compo-\nnents, providing flexibility and adaptability to di-\nverse user needs. A set of common and generally\napplicable elements is illustrated in Figure 3.\nThe Content-based Components define the in-\nformation provided to the LLM, including:\n• Task Instruction defines the primary goal, guid-\ning the model’s overall behavior.\n• Task Detail offers supplementary task-specific\ninformation, including resolution steps.\n• Output Format specifies the desired output\nstructure (e.g., JSON, bullet points, etc.).\n• Few-shot Examples provide specific instances\nfor contextual learning patterns.\n• Query shows the question or request to be an-\nswered by the LLM.\nThe Format-based Components dictate how\nthe prompt is assembled and presented, including:\n• Prompt Renderer defines how to aggregate all\ncomponents into a structured prompt.\n• Query Format: defines how to structure the ren-\ndering of examples and queries.\nNote that this template is highly adaptable. Users\ncan readily adjust the template by adding or delet-\ning components, or incorporating additional format-\nting elements (e.g., tables, structured documents)\nwithin existing components to suit their specific\nrequirements. By decoupling format from content,\nthis structured template empowers users to perform\ntargeted and precise optimizations, leading to im-\nproved prompt effectiveness.\n3.2 Component-wise Content Optimization\nBuilding upon existing prompt optimization strate-\ngies, which often rely on either feedback-driven\nrefinement or Monte-Carlo sampling (Section 2.2),\nCFPO introduces a more targeted and efficient ap-\nproach to content optimization. While feedback-\ndriven methods diagnose weaknesses through fail-\nure analysis, and Monte-Carlo sampling diversifies\nperspectives with semantic variations, CFPO inno-\nvates along two key dimensions.\nFirst, CFPO expands the diagnostic phase be-\nyond traditional failure analysis by incorporating\ncorrect cases. This allows the LLM to identify and\nreinforce successful aspects of the prompt, comple-\nmenting error correction. Second, CFPO adopts a\ncomponent-wise optimization strategy. Instead of\ntreating the prompt as a monolithic block, CFPO\ntargets specific content-based components for indi-\nvidual refinement, enabling more precise and effec-\ntive optimization.\n3.3 Format Optimization Design\nTo efficiently navigate the prompt format space,\nCFPO incorporates a format optimizer based on a\ndynamic format pool and an LLM-assisted gener-\nation module. The optimizer iteratively explores,\nevaluates, and refines formatting choices.\n3.3.1 Format Pool with Scoring System\nThe format pool maintains a diverse collection\nof prompt format configurations, organized hier-\narchically to represent variations at both macro\n(e.g., overall prompt structure) and micro (e.g.,\ncomponent-internal rendering) levels.

When a format f is evaluated on a new\ncontent c, its score is updated as follows: Q(f) ←\nQ(f) +m(c, f), where m(c, f) is a task-specific\nmetric function. For example, in reasoning tasks,\nm(·) represents the average accuracy (0 or 1) on an\nevaluation dataset. The number of evaluations for\neach format, N(f), is also tracked to enable score\nnormalization and fair comparison.\nTo initiate the format exploration process, we\ndefine an initial format search space, F, consisting\nof a set of predefined and commonly used formats\n(Figure 4), along with diverse variations that in-\ntroduce subtle changes (e.g., spacing, punctuation,\nspecial symbols). This initial format pool serves as\nthe foundation for subsequent exploration.\n3.3.2 LLM-assisted Format Generation\nTo overcome the limitations of a static format pool\nand promote continuous adaptation, we introduce\nan LLM-based format generator, LLMf_gen.

Furthermore, effective\nformats can improve the diversity and performance\nof content candidates, thereby helping content opti-\nmizer for beam search in the next iteration.\nIn summary, the content and format optimizers\nwork in tandem, leveraging the LLM to enable\nrapid adaptation and customization. This iterative\nand collaborative process optimizes both the con-\ntent and the format of prompts, leading to signifi-\ncant improvements in prompt quality.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Experimental Setups\nModels. We selected four open-source Large Lan-\nguage Models (LLMs) as our primary evaluation\ntargets, including two foundational models, Mistral-\n7B-v0.1 (Jiang et al., 2023) and LLaMA-3.1-\n8B (Meta, 2024b), as well as two instruction-tuned\nmodels, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct (Meta, 2024a) and\nPhi-3-Mini-Instruct (Microsoft, 2024). For content\nmutation and format generation during the opti-\nmization process, we employed GPT-4 (2024-05-\n01-preview) (OpenAI, 2024a).\nDatasets. Our evaluation benchmark was de-\nsigned to comprehensively assess model perfor-\nmance across a range of task types and difficulty\nlevels, emphasizing diverse query formats. Specifi-\ncally, we employed the following tasks:\n• Classification: The Implicatures task from the\nBig-Bench benchmark (bench authors, 2023).\n• Multiple-choice: ARC-Challenge (Clark et al.,\n2018) task.\n• Reasoning: GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and\nMATH500 (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Lightman\net al., 2023) requiring complex reasoning abili-\nties.\nBaselines. We compared CFPO with several com-\nmonly used and popular baselines. GrIPS (Prasad\net al., 2023) performs syntactic phrase-level ed-\nits in instruction, representing a non-LLM-based\noptimization approach. APE (Zhou et al., 2023)\nand ProTeGi (Pryzant et al., 2023) both employ\nLLM to optimize prompt content, but differ in mu-\ntation strategy. APE adopts an instruction induc-\ntion approach, while ProTeGi leverages test cases\nfeedback with LLM to guide the mutation process.\nSAMMO (Schnabel and Neville, 2024) introduces\na structured framework that incorporates a prelimi-\nnary format mutation strategy, which relies on ran-\ndom selection from a predefined format pool. All\nmethods were evaluated using consistent experi-\nmental configurations to ensure a fair comparison."}

To evaluate the gener-\nated prompts, we sample subsets from the training\nsplit for each benchmark (sizes: 50, 500, 500, and\n300 examples respectively). Beam search (bud-\nget of 8) is used during prompt mutations. Each\nexperiment was capped at 20 iterations. Early stop-\nping was implemented, halting the process if per-\nformance plateaus. The number of prompt com-\nponents the LLM could modify decreased linearly\nfrom 4 to 1 over the iterations (see Appendix B.1).\nWe start with a single in-context example without\nany further instruction as the initial prompt for each\nmodel and task, except for GrIPS which requires\nan initial instruction. Detailed parameter settings\nand procedure are in the Appendix B.\n4.2 Main Results\nTable 1 summarizes the performance of CFPO com-\npared with several state-of-the-art methods across\nfour datasets. The results highlight the superior\nperformance of CFPO, significantly outperforming\nthe baseline prompt and competing methods.\nThe effectiveness of CFPO is particularly ev-\nident when compared to methods like GRIPS,\nwhich relies solely on phrase-level mutations, yield-\ning only marginal improvements. This highlights\nthe importance of iterative feedback for effective\nprompt refinement, a feature shared by ProTeGi,\nSAMMO, and CFPO. Furthermore, CFPO incor-\nporates integrated format optimization that con-\ntributes significantly to the performance gains, par-\nticularly for previously challenging tasks.\nThe benefits of CFPO are particularly pro-\nnounced in reasoning tasks, such as GSM8K and\nMATH, known for their sensitivity to prompt struc-\nture. While improvements are observed on both\ndatasets, the impact is more noticeable on GSM8K\ncompared to the more complex MATH dataset, sug-\ngesting that task difficulty can moderate the attain-\nable performance gains from prompt optimization.\nBeyond performance metrics, we further eval-\nuate the stability of CFPO and the computational\ncost, as detailed in Appendix C. Examples of opti-\nmal prompts are detailed in Appendix E.\n4.3 Ablation Study\nImpact of the CFPO Pipeline Components.

Moreover, the it-\nerative nature of the optimization process, with\nmultiple mutation strategies, introduces computa-\ntional complexity, which could hinder scalability\nin resource-constrained environments. Finally, we\nacknowledge the inherent difficulty in definitively\nseparating content and format, especially in real-\nworld scenarios where structured data can be em-\nbedded within content.

The new\nformat should be distinct from the existing\nformats.\nThe variation can focus on two parts, CASING and\nSEPARATOR:\nCASING refers to both the capitalization of the\ntext (e.g., f(x) = x.title(), f(x) = x.upper(),\nf(x) = x.lower()) and the specific wording or\nphrasing used (e.g., changing \"question\" to \"\ninstruction\" or \"input\").\nSEPARATOR: the punctuation or symbols used to\nseparate the question and answer, there are some\ncandidates as for your reference {{'', ' ', '\\\\\nn', '--', ';\\\\n', ' ||', '<sep>', ' \\\\n', ':',\n'.'}}.\nNote that focus solely on the format itself\nwithout altering the content of the question and\nanswer. The format should remain focused on the\nexisting structure (e.g., Question/Answer or\nInstruction/Response) without modifying the\ncontent or introducing any new sections.

A set of 40 test cases is used, with\n5 correct and incorrect cases leveraged for case-\ndiagnosis. During optimization, the number of\nprompt components (e.g., Task Instruction, Task\nDetail, Output Format, Few-shot Examples) the\nLLM could modify simultaneously was dynami-\ncally adjusted across all the iterations. The number\nof components that could be modified decreases\nlinearly from 4 to 1 over the iterations, promoting\nbroad exploration of the prompt space initially and\nfine-grained refinement in later stages.\nFor format optimization, 4 UCT-selected formats\nand 4 newly generated formats are used to generate\nnew prompts. The coefficient in the UCT selection\nprocess α is set to 1e − 3.\nEach experiment was capped at a maximum of\n20 optimization iterations. An early stopping cri-\nterion was implemented, halting the process if the\nperformance did not improve for a specified num-\nber of consecutive iterations.\nB.2 Model Generation Parameters\nKey generation parameters for both the LLM opti-\nmizer (GPT-4) and the target evaluation models are\ndetailed below.\n• LLM Optimizer (GPT-4): We utilized the fol-\nlowing settings to generate and refine prompts:\ntop_p=1.0, max_tokens=4096, seed=42, and\ntemperature=1.0.\n• Evaluation Models: The target evalu-\nation model, evaluated on the gener-\nated prompts, was configured with:\ntop_p=0.1, max_tokens=256, seed=42,\ntemperature=0.0, repetition_penalty=\n1.0, and stop=’\\n’. The stop parameter\nensured the model ceased generation upon en-\ncountering a newline character. All generation\nprocesses were implemented using the vLLM\nlibrary (Kwon et al., 2023).\nB.3 Evaluation Metric\nPerformance across all tasks was evaluated using\nthe exact matchmetric. For direct answer tasks\n(BigBench-Classification and ARC-Challenge), the\nmodel’s direct prediction was assessed for an exact\nstring match with the ground truth. For Chain-of-\nThought reasoning tasks (GSM8K and MATH500),\nthe final numerical answer was extracted from the\ngenerated explanation and compared to the cor-\nrect solution for an exact match. Finally, the best-\nperforming prompt identified on the evaluation set\nfor each optimization method is reported on the\ncorresponding test set.\nB.4 Initial Prompt\nB.4.1 Big-Bench Classification\nPrompt Renderer: Directly Joint\nQuery Format: Input-Output\nExamples:\nInput: Speaker 1: 'You do this often?'

For the\npiecewise function to be continuous, the cases\nmust \"meet\" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$\nand $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This\nimplies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a\n=-6 \\Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-\nb$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we\nget $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$.

This expanded validation will be inte-\ngrated into the revised manuscript.\nFigure 5: Overview of in-context examples and text\nlengths for optimized prompts on various tasks and mod-\nels.\nModel CFPO Reproduced CFPO\nMistral-7B-v0.1 53.22 51.87 ± 0.22\nLlama-3.1-8B 63.38 62.70 ± 0.59\nLlama-3-8B-Instruct 80.74 80.67 ± 0.17\nPhi-3-Mini-Instruct 89.16 88.89 ± 0.31\nTable 6: Stability Analysis: Comparison of reported\nCFPO scores with reproduced results (4 runs each).\nC.2 Impact of In-context Examples and\nPrompt Length\nFigure 5 presents an overview of the number of in-\ncontext examples and the text length of optimized\nprompts across various tasks and models. An in-\nteresting pattern emerges: pre-trained models con-\nsistently prefer prompts with longer text and more\nin-context examples compared to instruction-tuned\nmodels. This observation suggests that pre-trained\nmodels benefit more from explicit context and de-\ntailed reasoning steps, which align with their less\ntask-specialized nature. In contrast, the relative\ninsensitivity of instruction-tuned models to prompt\nlength and in-context examples supports the notion\nthat these models have already trained with task-\nspecific knowledge during fine-tuning, reducing\ntheir dependence on highly detailed prompts.\nC.3 Stability and Convergence Analysis\nA crucial aspect of our framework is its stability.\nTo quantify this, we performed multiple indepen-\ndent runs of CFPO and analyzed the variance in"}

Table 6 presents a comparison of\nthe originally reported CFPO scores with the mean\nand standard deviation of scores obtained from four\nindependent runs. The consistently low standard\ndeviations across all models demonstrate the ro-\nbustness and stability of our CFPO framework.\nFurthermore, we examined the convergence be-\nhavior of content and format optimization. Prelim-\ninary analysis using Mistral-7B-v0.1 on GSM8K\n(Figure 6) indicates that format optimization may\nconverge faster than content optimization. The per-\nformance gains in each sub-round (content or for-\nmat optimization) are shown in parentheses. This\nsuggests that the optimization schedule could be\nrefined.\nThis difference in convergence speed could stem\nfrom the distinct optimization strategies: during\ncontent optimization, a diverse set of correct and\nincorrect examples is resampled from the training\nset in each round. In contrast, format optimization\nrelies on generating variations of existing formats,\nleading to reduced diversity as the UCT score con-\nverges. We hypothesize that allocating more re-\nsources to format optimization in early rounds, and\nsubsequently shifting focus to content optimization,\ncould improve overall efficiency. This is an area\nfor further investigation in future work.\nC.4 Cost Analysis\nAn important consideration is the computational\ncost associated with CFPO.

This study evalu-\nated the performance of several alternative LLMs\nin generating the formats used by CFPO, as shown\nin Table 9. We systematically replaced the orig-\ninal format generation LLM (GPT-4) with alter-\nnative models: Gemini-2.0, DeepSeekR1, Claude-\n3.5-Haiku, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. In these\nexperiments, GPT-4 was consistently used for con-\ntent optimization, and LLaMA-3.1-8B remained\nthe target model for evaluating performance on the\nGSM8K benchmark.\nThe results demonstrate that the choice of LLM\nfor format generation has a relatively minor im-\npact on overall accuracy. While variations in the\nspecific generated formats are observed across dif-\nferent LLMs, the consistent performance suggests\nthat CFPO’s effectiveness is not critically depen-\ndent on a single LLM. Specifically, as long as the\nLLM demonstrates the capability to generate vari-\nations and code based on the provided schema,\nthe downstream performance on GSM8K remains\nstable. This robustness suggests that the core prin-\nciples of CFPO are transferable and not tied to the\nidiosyncrasies of a particular LLM. This suggests\nCFPO is not overly sensitive to the choice of format\ngeneration model."}

Start by\naccurately determining the base numerical value.\nThen proceed by methodically listing every\nsignificant change whether it be increases,\ndecreases, or modifications that impacts this\nbase figure as the scenario unfolds, making sure\nto include each change in your overall\ncomputations. It's essential to focus on the\nconcept of compounded operations, whether they'\nre applied annually, monthly, or daily, and to\nthoughtfully evaluate the consequences of\nextraordinary events or circumstances (like an\nunexpected inheritance, a yearly loss, or a\nsingular occurrence with a major impact) that\nmight significantly shift the end calculations.\nSharpen your attention on the dynamics of\nnumerical relationships, particularly in cases\ninvolving ratios, proportions, and the impact of\npercentage changes over durations, to avoid\ncommon mistakes. Misunderstandings or\nmisapplications of these numerical relationships\ncan frequently cause inaccuracies. Thus, it is\ncritical to scrutinize these mathematical\nrelationships, whether they are of direct or\ninverse proportions, as well as the aggregate\neffects of consecutive percentage changes, as\noutlined in the problem description. This\nintensified attention is pivotal for an accurate\nand detailed resolution of complex issues,\nmarked by multiplicative elements and\ninterconnected circumstances. Reflect deeply on\nthe significance of every step in the\ncalculation process, absorbing the nuances of\nthese changes, to systematically arrive at the\nmost precise solution.\n**Ensuring Your Solution Fits the Scenario\nPerfectly**\nIn presenting your solution, ensure it comprises\nboth a numerical answer and a meticulously\ndetailed explanation of the process leading to\nit.

Additionally, every third week, he earns an\nextra $15, which occurs three times within 9\nweeks (in the 3rd, 6th, and 9th weeks). So, he\nearns an extra 3 * $15 = $45 from helping his\nneighbor. Therefore, the total amount Martin has\nsaved after 9 weeks is $90 + $45 = $135.\nQuestion: A teacher divides a class into groups\nfor a project.

Consider the\nexample of a system releasing information on the queries asked to a search engine over a period\nof time [KKMN09, BBD+21]. Such a system can provide valuable insights to researchers and the\npublic (for instance on health concerns [BBD+21]) but care is needed in ensuring that the queries\noutput do not leak private and sensitive user information.\nIn this paper, we focus on the problem of private partition selection [DVGM22, GGK+20] which\nmodels the challenge of extracting as much data as possible from such a dataset while respecting\nuser privacy. More formally, the setting of the problem (which is also known as private set union\nor private key discovery) is that each user has a private subset of items (e.g., the queries issued\nby the user) from an unknown and unbounded universe of items (e.g., all strings). The goal is to\noutput as many of the items in the users’ sets as possible (i.e., the queries issues by the users), while\nproviding a strong notion of privacy—User-level Differential Privacy (DP) [DR14].\nPrivate partition selection models many challenges beyond the example above, including\nthe problem of extracting the vocabulary (words, tokens or n-gram) present in a private cor-\npus [ZHQ+22, KGKY21]. This task is a fundamental prerequisite for many privacy-preserving\nnatural language processing algorithms [WZL+19, GGK+20], including for training language mod-\nels for sentence completion and response generation for emails [ KGKY21]. Similarly, learning\nembedding models over categorical data often requires to identify the categories present in a pri-\nvate dataset [GHK+23, GGK+24]. Partition selection underpins many other applications including\nanalyzing private streams [CR22, ZDK+23], learning sparse histograms [ BBCG+21], answering\nSQL queries [DVGM22] and sparsifying the gradients in the DP SGD method [GHK+23]. Unsur-\nprisingly given these applications, private partition selection algorithms [ KKMN09] are a core\nbuilding block of many standard differentially private libraries e.g., PyDP [PyD24], Google’s DP\nLibraries [Goo24, AGJ+22], and OpenMined DP Library [Ope24].\nReal-world datasets for these applications can be massive, potentially containing hundreds of\nbillions of data points, thus requiring algorithms for partition selection that can be efficiently run in\nlarge-scale data processing infrastructures—e.g., MapReduce [DG04], Hadoop [Apa], Spark [ZXW+16].\nIn our work, we design a highly parallelizable algorithm for this problem which requires constant\nparallel rounds in the Massively Parallel Computing model [KSV10] and does not assume to fit the\ninput in memory. This contrasts to prior algorithms such as [GGK+20, CWG22] which all require\n(with the key exception of the uniform weighting method described below) to process all the data\nsequentially on a single machine and assume storing the input in-memory thus precluding efficient\nparallelization.\n1.1 Weight and Threshold Approach\nBefore introducing our algorithm, we review the popular weighting-based approach to parti-\ntion selection which is used in many algorithms [ KKMN09, GGK+20, CWG22, SDH23]. This\napproach is of interest in the context of large-scale data as some of its variants can be parallelized\nefficiently [KKMN09, SDH23].\nNotice that differential privacy imposes to not output any item which is owned by only a single\nuser. However, it is possible for a private algorithm to output items which appear in many different\nsets. This intuition is at the basis of the weighting-based algorithms.\n1"}

Then, these algorithms proceed by increasing, for each user, the weight\nassociated the items present in the user data. Finally, the algorithm adds Gaussian (or Laplace)\nnoise to the total accumulated weight of each item, and outputting all items with noised weight\nabove a certain threshold [KKMN09, GGK+20, CWG22, SDH23]. The amount of noise and value\nof the threshold depends on the privacy parameters and crucially on the sensitivity of the weighting\nfunction to the addition or removal of any individual user’s set. Loosely speaking, the contribution\nof each user to the item weights must be bounded in order to achieve differential privacy. Algo-\nrithms within this framework differ in the choice of how to assign item weights, but in all designs\nthe key goal is that of limiting the sensitivity of the weighting function.\nA basic strategy is uniform weighting [KKMN09] where each user contributes equal weight to\neach of the items in their set. It is easy to bound the sensitivity of this basic weighting and thus\nto prove differential privacy. Because of its simplicity, the basic uniform weighting algorithm is\nextremely parallelizable requiring only basic counting operations over the items in the data.\nUnfortunately, however, uniform weighting is lossy in that it may overallocate weight far\nabove the threshold to high frequency items, missing an opportunity to boost the weight of items\ncloser to the decision boundary. This has inspired the design of greedy weighting schemes such\nas [GGK+20, CWG22] where each user’s allocations depend on data of previously analyzed users.\nAll of these algorithms are inherently sequential and require memory proportional to the items\npresent in the data.\nTo our knowledge, the uniform weighting [KKMN09] is essentially the only known solution\nto the private partition selection problem which is amenable to implementation in a massively\nparallel computation framework. The sole exception is the scalable, iterative partition selection\n(DP-SIPS) scheme of [SDH23] which has as core computation repeated invocations of the uniform\nweighting algorithm.\n1.2 Our Contributions\nIn this work, we design the first, adaptive, non-uniform weighting algorithm that is amenable to\nmassively parellel implementations. Our algorithm, called MaxAdaptiveDegree (MAD), requires\nlinear work in the size of the input and can be implemented in a constant number of rounds in a\nparallel framework. From a technical point of view, the algorithm is based on a careful rerouting\nof overallocated weight to less frequent items, that together with a delicate sensitivity analysis\nshows no privacy loss compared to uniform weighting. This means that—given the same privacy\nparameters—both algorithms utilize exactly the same amount of noise and the same threshold (but\nour algorithm can better allocate the weight). As a result, we are able to prove that our algorithm\nstochastically dominates the basic, uniform weighting strategy.\nWe extend our result to multiple rounds inMaxAdaptiveDegreeTwoRounds (MAD2R), split-\nting our privacy budget across the rounds, running MAD in each round, and outputting the union of\nitems found in both rounds. Similar to DP-SIPS, in the second round, we remove from the input any\nitems found in the first round (this is private by post-processing). By a careful generalization of the\nprivacy analysis of the weight and threshold approach, we show that it is possible to also use the\nnoisy weights from the prior round. We leverage this in two ways. First, we additionally remove\nitems which have very small weights from the first round–these have little chance of being output\nin the second round. Second, we bias the weighting produced byMAD in the second round to further\n2"}

The combination of\nthese ideas yields significant empirical improvements over both the basic algorithm and DP-SIPS.\nIn MAD, users with a too small or large of a cardinality (we equivalently refer to this as the user’s\ndegree) are labeled non-adaptive: these users will add uniform weight to their items (or biased\nweight in the case of MAD2R). The rest of the users participate in adaptive reweighting with the\nprivacy analysis making use of the upper bound on their degree. Initially each of these users sends\na small amount of weight uniformly among their items (the total amount of weight sent per user is\nbounded by 1 rather than the square root of their degree, which is the case for the basic weighting\nalgorithm). Then, items with weight significantly above the threshold are truncated to only have\nweight slightly above the threshold (we do not want to truncate all the way to the threshold as the\nadded noise can decrease weights). The weight removed via truncation is returned to each user\nproportional to their initial contributions. Then, users reroute a carefully chosen fraction of this\n“excess” weight back to their items. Finally, users add additional uniform weight to their items to\nmake up for the small amount of weight that was initially sent.\nBounding the sensitivity of MAD requires a careful analysis and is significantly more involved\nthan for basic weighting. Several design choices made in our algorithm, such as using an initial\nuniform weighting inversely proportional to cardinality rather than square root of cardinality,\nusing a minimum and maximum adaptive degree, and choosing the fraction of how much excess\nweight to reroute are all required for the following theorem to hold. Furthermore, we generalize\nthe analysis of the weight and threshold paradigm to allow us to use noisy weights from first round\nin biasing weights in the second round of MAD2R. This biasing further complicates the sensitivity\nanalysis of MAD which we address by putting limits on the minimum and maximum bias.\nTheorem 1.1 (Privacy, Informal version of Theorem 5.1 and Corollary 5.2). Using MAD as the weighting\nalgorithm achieves (ε, δ)-DP with the exact same noise and threshold parameters as the basic algorithm.\nRunning MAD in two rounds with biases via MAD2R is (ε, δ)-DP .\nWithin MAD, items have their weight truncated if it exceeds an “adaptive threshold” τ after\nadding the initial weights. τ is set to be β standard deviations of the noise above the true threshold\nthat will be used to determine the output where β ≥ 0 is a free parameter of the algorithm. By\ndesign, before adding noise, every item which receives at least weight τ in the basic algorithm\nwill also receive weight at least τ by MAD. Furthermore, the weights on all other items will only be\nincreased under MAD compared to the basic algorithm. Taking the final step of adding noise, we\nshow the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.2 (Stochastic Dominance, Informal version of Theorem 6.1) .

Then, for items i ∈ Uand a free parameter β ≥ 0,\n• If Pr(i ∈ U) < Φ(β), then Pr(i ∈ U∗) ≥ Pr(i ∈ U).\n• Otherwise, Pr(i ∈ U∗) ≥ Φ(β).\nwhere Φ is the standard Gaussian cdf.\nCompared to the basic algorithm, MAD has a higher probability of outputting any item that\ndoes not reach the adaptive threshold in its initial stage as it reroutes excess weight to these items.\nThe theorem shows that MAD stochastically dominates the basic algorithm on these items.

In Section 6, we also describe a simple, concrete\nfamily of instances where MAD significantly improves upon the baselines.\nFinally, we conduct experiments on several publicly-available datasets with up to 800 billions\nof (user, item) pairs (up to three orders of magnitude larger than prior datasets used in sequential\nalgorithms). Our algorithm outperforms scalable baselines and is competitive with the sequential\nbaselines.\n1.3 Related Work\nOur algorithms are in the area of privacy preserving algorithms with differential privacy guarantee\nwhich is the de facto standard of privacy (we refer to [DR14] for an introduction to this area). As\nwe covered the application and prior work on private partition selection in the introduction, we\nnow provide more details on the work most related to our paper.\nThe differentially private partition selection problem was first studied in [ KKMN09]. They\nutilized the now-standard approach of subsampling to limit the number of items in each user’s set,\nconstructing weights over items, and thresholding noised weights to produce the output. They\nproposed a version of the basic weighting algorithm which uses the Laplace mechanism rather\nthan the Gaussian mechanism. This algorithm was also used in [WZL+20] within the context of a\nprivate SQL system. The problem received renewed study in [GGK+20] where the authors propose\na generic class of greedy, sequential weighting algorithms which empirically outperform basic\nweighting (with either the Laplace or Gaussian mechanism). [CWG22] gave an alternative greedy,\nsequential weighting algorithm which leverages item frequencies in cases where each user has a\nmultiset of items. [DVGM22] analyzed in depth the optimal strategy when each user has only a\nsingle item (all sets have cardinality one). This is the only work that does not utilize the weight\nand threshold approach, but it is tailored only for this special case. The work most related to\nours is DP-SIPS [SDH23] which proposes the first algorithm other than basic weighting which is\namenable to implementation in a parallel environment. DP-SIPS splits the privacy budget over\na small number of rounds, runs the basic algorithm as a black box each round, and iteratively\nremoves the items found in previous rounds for future computations. This simple idea leads to\nlarge empirical improvements, giving a scalable algorithm that has competitive performance with\nsequential algorithms.\n2 Preliminaries\nDefinition 2.1 (Differentially-Private Partition Selection). In the differentially-private partition\nselection (a.k.a. private set union or key selection) problem, there are n users with each user u\nhaving a set Su of items from an unknown and possibly infinite universe Σ of items: the input\nis of the form S = {(u, Su)}u∈[n]. The goal is to output a set of items U of maximum cardinality,\nsuch that U is a subset of the union of the users’ sets U = ∪u∈[n]Su, while maintaining user-level\ndifferentially privacy.\nAs standard in prior work [ KKMN09, GGK+20, CWG22, SDH23] we consider the central\ndifferential privacy model, where the input data is available to a curator that runs the algorithm\n4"}

Input is a set of user sets\nS = {(u, Su)}u∈[n], privacy parameters ε and δ, a maximum degree cap ∆0, and a weighting\nalgorithm ALG (which can itself take some optional input parameters), and a function h : N → R\nwhich describes the sensitivity of ALG.\nFirst, each user’s set is randomly subsampled so that the size of each resulting set is at most ∆0\n(the necessity of this step will be further explicated). Then, the ALG takes in the cardinality-capped\nsets and produces a set of weights over all items in the union. Independent Gaussian noise with\nstandard deviation σ is added to each coordinate of the weights, and items with weight above a\ncertain threshold ρ are output. By construction, this algorithm will only ever output items which\nbelong to the true union, U ⊆ U, with the size of the output depending on the number of items\nwith noised weight above the threshold.\nFor the sake of analysis (and not the implementation of the algorithm), we diverge from prior\nwork to return a vector ˜wext of noisy weights over the entire universe Σ. This vector is implicitly\nused in the proof of privacy for releasing the set of items U, but it is never materialized as |Σ| is\nunbounded. Within our algorithms, we will ensure that we only ever query entries of this vector\nwhich belong to U, so we only ever have to materialize those entries. Note, however, that it would\nnot be private to release ˜w as the output of a final algorithm as the domain of that vector is exactly\nthe true union of the users’ sets.\nThe privacy of this algorithm depends on certain “sensitivity” properties of ALG as well as our\nchoice of σ and ρ. Consider any pair of neighboring inputs S and S′ = S ∪ {(v, Sv)}, let U and U′\nbe the corresponding unions, and let w and w′ be the item weights assigned by ALG on the two\ninputs, respectively.\nDefinition 3.1. The ℓ2 sensitivity of a weighting algorithm is defined as the smallest value ∆2 such\nthat,\n∆2 ≥\nsX\ni∈U\n(w′(i) − w(i))2 +\nX\ni∈U′\\U\nw′(i)2.\nGiven bounded ℓ2 sensitivity, choosing the scale of noise σ appropriately for the Gaussian\nmechanism in Proposition 2.4 ensures that outputting the noised weights on items in U satisfies\u0000\nε, δ\n2\n\u0001\n-DP . So if we knewU, then the output of the algorithm after thresholding would be private\nvia post-processing.\nHowever, knowledge of the union U is exactly the problem we want to solve. The challenge is\nthat there may be items in U′ which do not appear in U. Let T = U′ \\ Ube these “novel” items with\nt = |T|. As long as the probability that any of these items are output by the algorithm is at most\nδ\n2, (ε, δ)-DP will be maintained. Consider a single item i ∈ T which has zero probability of being\noutput by a weight and threshold algorithm run on S but is given some weight w′(i) when ALG is\nrun on S′. The item will be output only if after adding the Gaussian noise with standard deviation\nσ, the noised weight exceeds ρ. The probability that any item in T is output follows from a union\nbound. In order to union bound only over finitely many events, we rely on the fact that t ≤ ∆0; this\nis why the cardinalities must be capped. This motivates the second important sensitivity measure\nof ALG.\nDefinition 3.2. The novel ℓ∞ sensitivity of a weighting algorithm is parameterized by the number\nt = |T| of items which are unique to the new user, and is defined as the smallest value ∆∞(t) such\n6"}

Items have their weights truncated toτ and any excess weight is sent back to the\nusers proportional to the amount they contributed. Users then reroute a carefully chosen fraction\n(depending on dmax) of this excess weight across their items. Finally, each user adds 1/√\n|Su| − 1/|Su|\nto the weight of each of their items.\nEach of these stages requires linear work in the size of the input, i.e. the sum of the sizes of the\nusers sets. Furthermore, each stage is straightforward to implement within a parallel framework.\nAs there are a constant number of stages, the algorithm can be implemented with total linear work\nand constant number of rounds.\n4.1 MAD2R: Biased Weights in Multiple Rounds\nThis unbiased version of MAD directly improves on the basic algorithm. We further optimize our\nalgorithm by refining an idea from the prior work of DP-SIPS [SDH23]. In that work, the privacy\nbudget is split across multiple rounds with Basic used in each round. In each round, items found\nin previous rounds are removed from the users’ sets, so that in early rounds, easy-to-output (loosely\nspeaking, high frequency) items are output, with more weight being allocated to harder-to-output\nitems in future rounds. The privacy of this approach follows from post-processing: we can freely\nuse the differentially private output U from early rounds to remove items in later rounds.\nWe propose MaxAdaptiveDegreeTwoRounds (MAD2R) which as a starting point runs MAD in\ntwo rounds, splitting the privacy budget as in DP-SIPS. As MAD stochastically dominates Basic,\nthis provides a drop-in improvement. Our key insight comes from the modified meta-algorithm\n8"}

In this case, w∗(i) ≥ w(i). In the adaptive algorithm, no weight is truncated\nfrom the initial weights, and so each user contributes to the final weight of an item 1√\n|Su| plus\nrerouted weight from other items. As the weight on itemi only increases for the adaptive algorithm\ncompared to the basic algorithm, the probability of outputting i also can only increase.\nCase 2: w∗\ninit(i) > τ. In this case in the adaptive algorithm, the initial weight is truncated to τ,\nexcess weight is rerouted, and a final addition of 1√\n|Su| − 1\n|Su| is added. As |Su| ≥1, the final weight\nw∗(i) ≥ τ. Then, i ∈ U∗ if the added Gaussian noise does not drops the weight below the threshold\nρ, i.e., if the noise is greater than or equal to\nρ − τ = ρ − (ρ + βσ) = −βσ.\nAs the noise has zero mean and standard deviation σ, this probability is exactly 1 − Φ(−β) =\nΦ(β).\n6.2 Example showing a gap between MAD and parallel baselines\nWhile Theorem 6.1 bounds the worst-case behavior of our algorithm compared to the basic algo-\nrithm, as MAD increases the weight of items below τ compared to the basic algorithm, it will often\nhave a larger output. We show a simple, explicit example where our algorithm will substantially\nincrease the output probability of all but one item.\nHere, we demonstrate an explicit setting where MAD outperforms the baselines. There are n\nusers each with degree 3 as well as a single heavy item i∗ and m light items. Each user’s set is\ncomprised of i∗ as well as two random light items. Under the basic algorithm, each user will\ncontribute 1/\n√\n3 to each of their items. Therefore, the weights under Basic are\nw(i) =\n( n√\n3 if i = i∗\n2n√\n3m < 1.16n\nm o.w. .\nOn the other hand, assuming n >> τ, MAD will reroute almost all of the initial weight on the\nheavy item back to the users, so each user will have excess weight approximately 1/3. For dmax = 3,\nwe get discount factor α >0.5. So, each user will send approximately 1/18 weight to each of its\nitems. The weights under MAD are\nw(i) =\n(\nτ + n\n18 if i = i∗\n2n\nm\n\u0010\n1√\n3 + 1\n18\n\u0011\n< 1.27n\nm o.w. .\nIn this setting, our algorithm will assign close to 10% more weight to the light items (resulting\nin substantially higher probability of output) compared to the basic algorithm. If n/m is close to the\ntrue threshold ρ, this gap will have a large effect on the final output size. We empirically validate\nthis for n = 15,000, m= 1000, ε= 1, δ= 10−5. Our algorithm returns 610 items on average. The\nbasic algorithm returns 519 items while DP-SIPS with a privacy split of 5%, 15%, 80% or 10%, 90%\nreturns 332 or 514 items, respectively. In all cases, as expected, our algorithm has significantly\nhigher average output size.\n20"}

Clueweb [BRSV11] is a dataset of\nweb pages and their hyper-links, items corresponds to the hyperlinks on a web page and each page\ncorresponds to a user. Common Crawl is a very-large text dataset of crawled web pages often used\nin LLM research.\n7.2 Algorithms and Parameters\nWe compare our results to both sequential and parallel algorithms from prior work.

First we implement a sequential,\nin-memory version of all algorithms (including the parallel ones) using Python.6. For PolicyGaus-\nsian and GreedyUpdate we use the Python implementations from prior work [GGK+20, CWG22].\nThis allows us to fairly test the scalability of the algorithms not using parallelism. As we observe\nnext, this approach does not scale to the two largest datasets we have (Clueweb, Common Crawl).\nThen, we implement all parallel algorithms ( MAD, MAD2R, Basic, DP-SIPS) using C++ in\na modern multi-machine massively parallel computation framework in our institution. This\nframework allows to use a fleet of shared (x86 64) architecture machines with 2.45GHz clocks. The\nmachines are shared by several projects and can have up to 256 cores and up to 512GB of RAM. The\njobs are dynamically allocated RAM, machines and cores depending on need and availability. As\nwe observe, all parallel algorithm are very scalable and run on these huge datasets within 4 hours\nof wall-clock time. On the other hand, both sequential algorithms cannot exploit this architecture\nand could not complete in 16 hours on the Clueweb dataset (we estimate they would take several\ndays to complete on the Common Crawl dataset even assuming access to enough memory).\n7.4 Results\nAlgorithm Comparison Table 2 displays the output size of the DP partition selection algorithms\n(i.e., the number of privatized items output). Among parallel algorithms, MAD2R achieves the best\nresult on seven out of nine datasets. The two exceptions are the Higgs dataset, where MAD performs\nthe best, and the Clueweb dataset, where DP-SIPS performs the best. Both of these datasets have\noutlier statistics (see Table 1): the average size of a user set in the Higgs dataset is less than 2 and\nthe number of unique items in the Clueweb dataset is less than the number of users. Directly\ncomparing MAD with Basic, MAD is always better, corroborating our proof of stochastic dominance.\nComparing MAD2R with DP-SIPS, MAD2R is almost always significantly better, by up to a factor of a\n9.5% improvement on the IMDb dataset.\nOn the small scale datasets where we can run sequential algorithms, as expected from prior\nwork [SDH23], one of the two sequential algorithms yield the best results across all algorithms with\nPolicyGaussian consistently outperforming all parallel baselines. GreedyUpdate’s performance\nis heavily dataset dependent, sometimes performing the best and sometimes the worst out of\nall algorithms. This is not a surprise as the sequential algorithms utilize much more adaptivity\nthan even our adaptive parallel algorithm at the cost of limiting scalability. Our algorithm is still\ncompetitive, never outputting fewer than 86% of the items of PolicyGaussian (and outperforming\nGreedyUpdate on many datasets). For massive datasets, where it is simply infeasible to run the\nsequential algorithms, however MAD2R has the best results of all parallel algorithms.\nFigures comparing output sizes while varying ε, δ, ∆0, and dmax are included in Figures 2 to 5.\nThe relative performance of the algorithms is the same across many choices.\nAbsolute Utility To understand the absolute utility of our algorithms (as opposed to relative\nto other baselines), we focus on the performance of MAD2R on the Reddit and Common Crawl\ndatasets. In order to understand the performance in a real deployment rather than compare\n6An open-source Python implementation of our algorithm is available at https://github.com/jusyc/dp_\npartition_selection.\n25"}

On the other\nhand, 98% of users have at least one outputted item, and 45% of the entries (user-item pairs) belong\nto an item which is output by our algorithm. The relatively small overall fraction of items output is\ndue in part to the fact that the Reddit dataset has 58% singleton items (items only appearing in a\nsingle user’s set). Any algorithm which outputs any singleton items is not private, as it is leaking\nprivate information belonging to a single user. For any algorithm with acceptable privacy settings,\noutputting items with very small frequencies is also simply not possible. In Figure 1a, we break\ndown the number of items total in the dataset and the number output by MAD2R broken down by\nitem frequency. Our algorithm returns almost all of the items with frequency at least 100.\nOn the Common Crawl dataset, MAD2R outputs 16,551,550 out of 1,803,720,630 unique items\n(0.9%). On the other hand, 99.9% of users have at least one outputted item and 97% of entries in the\ndataset belong to an item in output by our algorithm. This dataset contains 61% singleton items,\nand many low frequency items. In Figure 1b, we break down the number of items total in the\ndataset and the number output by MAD2R broken down by item frequency. Our algorithm returns\nan overwhelming fraction of items occuring in at least 200 user sets on a dataset with billions of\nusers overall.\n8 Conclusion\nWe introduceMAD and MAD2R, new parallel algorithms for private partition selection which provide\nstate-of-the-art results, scale to massive datasets, and provably outperform baseline algorithms.\nClosing the remaining gap between parallel and sequential algorithms remains an interesting\ndirection, as well as developing new ideas to adaptive route weight to items below the privacy\nthreshold while maintaining bounded sensitivity. While we are able to prove ordinal theoretical\nresults (our algorithm is at least as good as another), it is an open challenge to develop a framework\nwhere we can prove quantitative results, perhaps comparing the competitive ratio of a private\npartition selection algorithm compared to some reasonably defined optimum.\n26"}

Advanced language models, decision-making bots, and\ndomain-specific AI services are increasingly expected to interact with one another to tackle\ncomplex tasks that no single system can handle alone. This transition to multi-agent AI\necosystems promises significant gains in efficiency and capability, but it also raises a critical\nchallenge: ensuring that these diverse agents can communicate and coordinate effectively across\ndifferent platforms and organizations.\nToday, efforts to connect AI agents remain fragmented. Various groups have introduced their\nown agent-to-agent frameworks—ranging from proprietary enterprise solutions to open-source\nprojects—yet none has emerged as a universal standard. For example, major cloud providers\nhave launched protocols like Google’s Agent2Agent (A2A) to facilitate cross-platform agent\ninteraction [18], while open consortia such as Cisco’s AGNTCY initiative are pursuing an\n“Internet of Agents” vision for interoperable agent collaboration [15]. Similarly, researchers at\nMIT have introduced NANDA, a decentralized agent framework focused on robust coordination\nand composability across AI systems1. These initiatives highlight the strong demand for agent\ninteroperability. However, they remain largely siloed, each addressing only parts of the problem\nwithin limited ecosystems. The result is a patchwork of incompatible approaches that hinders\nagents developed in different environments from truly working together.\nCoral Protocol is designed to unify these disparate efforts by providing a common foundation\nfor AI agent collaboration. Conceived as an open and vendor-neutral infrastructure, Coral offers\na standardized way for agents—regardless of who built them or what frameworks they run\non—to communicate, share knowledge, and coordinate tasks. By serving as a general-purpose\nlingua franca for agents, Coral breaks down integration silos and accelerates the emergence\nof robust multi-agent services. It builds upon lessons learned from earlier protocols but goes\nfurther, combining communication, coordination, and security capabilities into one cohesive\nplatform for agent interaction.\nUnlike its predecessors that often focused on either networking or task orchestration in\nisolation, Coral delivers a holistic solution for multi-agent interoperability. Its core capabilities\ncan be summarized as follows:\n• Structured Interaction Mediation: Coral manages all communication between users\nand agents, as well as between agents themselves. Through persistent threads and mention-\nbased targeting, it ensures that conversations remain organized, contextual, and effi-\ncient—without requiring agents to poll continuously or interpret unstructured input.\n• Dynamic Agent Discovery and Capability Registration: Agents can advertise\ntheir capabilities and discover others through standardized mechanisms, allowing seamless\ncomposition of multi-agent coordinations without hardcoded integrations or platform-\nspecific logic.\n• Secure Team Formation and Task Execution Coordination: Coral enables the\non-demand assembly of agent teams with authenticated identities, assigned roles, and\ncontrolled data access. Teams can collaboratively execute complex tasks while preserving\nprivacy, trust, and auditability via a secure coordination layer and optional blockchain-based\nlogging.\n• Modular Tool and Data Integration: Via Coralizer modules, developers can onboard\nmodels, tools, and datasets—transforming them into \"Coralized\" agents accessible within\nthe ecosystem. This modular onboarding allows for scalable growth of capabilities without\ncompromising interoperability.\n1NANDA: The Internet of AI Agents,https://nanda.media.mit.edu, accessed on April 18, 2025.\nJuly 18, 2025 Page 4"}

We cover recent progress in large language models, autonomous AI agents and\ntheir use of tools, the emergence of model context protocols, and the advent of multi-agent AI\nsystems. Together, these advances set the stage for why a unifying interoperability protocol is\nneeded.\n2.1 Large Language Models (LLMs)\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are very large neural networks trained on massive text datasets\nto predict and generate text. Modern LLMs are built on the transformer architecture, which uses\nself-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in text [20]. Scaling up model size\nand training data has proven remarkably effective: for example, OpenAI’s GPT-3 (2020) with 175\nbillion parameters demonstrated that increasing model scale dramatically improves performance\non a wide range of tasks without task-specific training, enabling strongfew-shot learning abilities\n[3]. This means GPT-3 could be prompted with a few examples and then perform tasks like\ntranslation or Q&A at near state-of-the-art levels [3]. Such emergent capabilities were a surprise\nand highlighted the potential of \"foundation models\" – general-purpose models that can be\nadapted to many applications [2].\nSince 2020, LLM development has accelerated. Researchers introduced techniques to make\nLLMs more useful and aligned with human intentions. Notably, fine-tuning models with human\nfeedback and instructions (often via reinforcement learning from human feedback) has led to\nmore reliable and safer AI assistants [10]. This approach was used to createInstructGPT and\nultimately ChatGPT in 2022, greatly improving the model’s ability to follow user instructions\npolitely and correctly [10]. The year 2023 saw the release of even more advanced LLMs such\nas GPT-4, which not only improved text understanding and reasoning but also introduced\nmultimodal capabilities (accepting image inputs) [14]. Other organizations have developed\ncompetitive LLMs (e.g., Google’s PaLM and Meta’s LLaMA), including open-source models,\nexpanding access to this technology. Today’s state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit strong language\nunderstanding, reasoning via chain-of-thought, and even basic tool use. They serve as the\n\"brains\" for many AI agent systems and are the foundational technology that Coral Protocol\nbuilds upon. Practical applications of LLMs now range from code generation and data analysis\nto powering chat assistants and domain-specific experts. The rapid post-2020 progress in LLM\ncapabilities and availability has set the stage for autonomous AI agents that can leverage these\nmodels’ general intelligence.\n2.2 AI Agents\nIn AI, anagent refers to a system that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve\ngoals. The concept of intelligent agents has long been studied in classical AI [19], but recent\nadvances in LLMs have given rise to a new breed of AI agents endowed with powerful language\nand reasoning skills. These agents use LLMs as their core, enabling them to interpret instructions,\nplan actions, and carry out complex tasks autonomously. In essence, an AI agent combines an\nLLM’s general knowledge with a decision-making loop: it can observe some input (or environment\nstate), reason about what to do (often internally via \"chain-of-thought\" text), and then act\n(produce outputs or manipulate tools).\nA key development enabling modern AI agents was the realization that LLMs can be\nprompted not just to answer questions, but tothink step-by-step andact in a task-oriented\nmanner. For example, the ReAct framework [22] showed that an LLM can intermix reasoning\nsteps with actionable commands, using its internal chain-of-thought to decide which external\naction to take next [22]. In the ReAct paradigm, the model generatesreasoning traces(e.g.\nJuly 18, 2025 Page 6"}

This synergy of reasoning and acting allows an agent to break down\ncomplex problems, leverage external information when needed, and adjust its plan based on the\nresults of its actions. For instance, an LLM-based agent can iteratively decide to perform a web\nsearch, read the results, and then use that information to answer a hard question – effectively\nself-guiding its behavior.\nBeyond research prototypes, practical AI agent frameworks have proliferated. Several 2023\nprojects (many open-source) demonstratedautonomous agentspowered by GPT-4 or similar\nmodels that can execute multi-step plans. Examples include systems like \"AutoGPT\" and\n\"BabyAGI,\" which loop an LLM’s outputs back into itself to create continuous task planning\nand execution cycles. These agents maintain a form of working memory (often a summary of\npast steps or an external vector database) and can spawn sub-agents for subtasks. While often\nexperimental, they illustrate the growing aspiration forAI agents that can operate with\nminimal human intervention, handling tasks like researching a topic, managing schedules,\nor even controlling a computer. In academia, researchers have explored agents that carry out\nextended interactions or exhibit human-like behavior. For example, Generative Agents [11]\npopulated a simulated world with multiple LLM-driven characters thatplan, remember,\nand interactdynamically, producing believable human-like behaviors over long periods. Such\nexperiments show that LLM agents can in principle manage complex goals and social interactions\nwhen given appropriate architectures for memory and planning.\nThe practical relevance of AI agents is significant: they have the potential to automate tasks\nthat normally require human-like judgment or complex decision processes, from customer service\nchats to orchestrating business workflows. Companies are beginning to deploy autonomous agents\nin roles like scheduling, IT support (e.g. auto-triaging requests), and data monitoring. However,\ncreating robust agent systems remains challenging. Agents need to ground their decisions in\nreliable data (to avoid purely \"imagining\" incorrect actions) and operate within constraints (to\nensure safety and alignment with user intentions). These needs motivate the use of external\ntools and standardized protocols, as we discuss next. Overall, the convergence of LLMs with\nthe agent paradigm has led to a flurry of progress post-2020 in what some call \"agentic AI\" –\nAI systems that proactively take initiative and perform extended tasks. This sets the stage for\nnetworks of such agents working together, which is exactly the scenario Coral Protocol targets.\n2.3 Tools as Extensions of AI Agents\nA remarkable aspect of human intelligence is the ability to use tools – instruments that extend\nour capabilities. Similarly, AI agents can greatly expand their competence by using external\ntools to complement the knowledge contained in their model parameters. In the context of\nLLM-based agents, \"tools\" usually refer to any external system the agent can invoke via an\nAPI or function call: examples include search engines, databases, calculators, code execution\nenvironments, or even other machine learning models. By using tools, an AI agent can obtain\nup-to-date information, perform precise computations, interact with the physical world (through\nAPIs to devices or services), and generally overcome the static knowledge limitations of its\ntrained model.\nThe idea of tool-use in AI gained traction as researchers observed that LLMs, while very\nknowledgeable, still have constraints (e.g. fixed training data cutoff, limited factual accuracy on\nniche or recent info, etc.). Giving an agent the ability to fetch information or execute code on the\nfly can address these gaps. One early demonstration was OpenAI’sWebGPT, where an LLM"}

Toolformer demonstrated\nthat a language model can learn to use tools such as a dictionary, calculator, or search engine in\na zero-shot manner, leading to higher accuracy on tasks requiring those tools. The practical\nupshot is that an LLM doesn’t need to internally solve everything – it can learn to delegate\nsub-tasks to a tool that’s better suited for it.\nA major real-world milestone in this area was the introduction ofAPI calling and plugins\nfor ChatGPT (2023). OpenAI enabled a standardized way for the model to invoke external\nfunctions provided by developers (e.g. retrieve stock prices, book a calendar event, or run a\ncode snippet). This concept, analogous to a plugin system for the AI, showed how a single\nAI agent could interact with many services safely through a defined interface. Microsoft’s\nHuggingGPT project went a step further: it treated ChatGPT as a controller that orchestrates\ncalls to numerous expert models on HuggingFace (for vision, speech, etc.), essentially using\nspecialist AI models as tools to solve multi-modal tasks [14]. By parsing a user request and\nbreaking it into steps handled by appropriate models, HuggingGPT achieved impressive results\nacross language, vision, and audio tasks that no single model could handle alone.\nIn summary, tool integration has become an essential part of advanced AI agent design. It\noffers practical benefits: agents can access real-time information (via web or database queries),\nperform actions on behalf of users (e.g., send an email, control a smart home device), and tackle\nproblems (like math or code execution) that are difficult to solve with pure neural reasoning.\nPost-2020, we’ve seen rapid progress in frameworks that make tool-use easier – from research\nprototypes to robust libraries (e.g., LangChain, which simplifies connecting LLMs to tools).\nHowever, these integrations have often been ad-hoc, with each system defining its own set of\ntools and APIs. This fragmentation has paved the way for efforts to standardize how agents\ndiscover and use tools, which is where theModel Context Protocolcomes in.\n2.4 Model Context Protocol (MCP)\nAs AI agents proliferate, each with potentially different developers and tool suites, a clear\nchallenge arises: How can an agent easily access a wide range of tools and data sources, especially\nthose it wasn’t originally built to use? And conversely, how can developers expose new tools or\ndatasets such that any compliant AI agent can utilize them without custom integration? The\nModel Context Protocol (MCP)is a recently introduced answer to these questions. MCP\nis an open standard (first released in late 2024) that defines a common interface for connecting\nAI models (or agents) with external resources, in a way that is general and vendor-agnostic\n([Introducing the Model Context Protocol [1].\nIn essence, MCP provides auniversal languagefor AI agents to request access to data or\nfunctionality, and for tools/servers to offer that access. Anthropic, the company behind the\nClaude LLM, spearheaded MCP to break down the \"silos\" that trap AI systems away from the\ndata and tools they need [1]. Traditionally, if you wanted your AI agent to use a new database\nor API, you had to wire up a bespoke connector for that specific combination of agent and tool.\nThis led to anN ×M integration problem (withN AI systems andM tools all needing pairwise\nconnectors), causing duplication of effort and inconsistent implementations.\nConcretely, MCP defines a client–server model.

This setupdecouplesAI models from tools: agents\nand tools can be developed independently so long as both conform to MCP. This is analogous to\nhow web browsers and web servers interoperate via HTTP – a universal protocol.\nMCP’s design was inspired in part by the success of the Language Server Protocol (LSP) in\nsoftware development [17]. Just as LSP allows any code editor to interface with any programming\nlanguage’s analysis engine through a common protocol, MCP aims to let any AI agent interface\nwith any tool or context provider. The MCP specification covers various types of \"context\" that\nan agent might need. These includeresources (documents or data that the model can read),\ntools/functions (operations the model can invoke), and even sharedprompts or templates\n(reusable pieces of guidance for the model). By standardizing these, MCP makes it easier to\nshare not only data, but also behaviors. For example, a company could develop an MCP server\nfor their internal knowledge base and another for their CRM system; any MCP-compliant AI\nassistant (from any vendor) could then query those seamlessly. This universality promises\nto reduce re-implementation and enable richerecosystems of AI capabilities. Indeed, early\nadopters of MCP have demonstrated scenarios like an AI coding assistant pulling info from a\nproject’s GitHub repository and issue tracker via MCP, or a customer support agent retrieving\nuser history from a CRM – all through the same protocol [1].\nIt’s worth noting that MCP is one of a few efforts emerging to standardize AI-tool interactions.\nAround the same time, Google introduced anAgent-to-Agent (A2A)communication protocol\nwith similar goals of interoperability [17]. The momentum behind these initiatives signals a\nrecognition that as we integrate AI into many applications, we need commoninterfaces to\navoid each AI system becoming an isolated silo. For the general tech community, MCP is\nsignificant because it could do for AI what APIs did for web services – provide a lingua franca\nenabling diverse systems to work together. In the context of Coral Protocol, MCP represents a\nfoundational step towards an open infrastructure where specialized AI agents can share context\nand services. Coral builds upon this idea of interoperability, extending it to not just tool access\nbut also agent-to-agent collaboration in a broader network (as we’ll see later). In short, MCP and\nsimilar standards pave the way forplug-and-play AI components: you can mix and match\nmodels, tools, and data sources with minimal friction, which is crucial for scalable multi-agent\necosystems.\n2.5 Multi AI Agent Systems\nMoving beyond single agents, the next frontier is systems composed ofmultiple AI agents\nworking in concert. Just as groups of humans can collaborate by dividing labor or bringing\ndifferent expertise, multiple AI agents could, in theory, tackle complex tasks more effectively by\ncommunicating and specializing. Research in multi-agent systems is not new – it has existed for\ndecades in fields like distributed AI and robotics. However,LLM-based multi-agent systems have\nonly recently become feasible and are now an exciting area of development [19]. The general idea\nis to have a collection of agents (each potentially with different roles, knowledge, or abilities)\nthat interact with each other to solve problems or create richer simulations.\nThere are several motivations for using multiple AI agents together. One isspecialization:\none agent might be an expert in math, another in coding, another in interacting with humans.\nBy having them communicate, each sub-problem can be handled by the best-suited agent.

In other words, we’re beginning to\nmove from thinking about one AI in isolation to networks of AIs collaborating, which some see\nas steps toward an \"artificial collective intelligence.\"\nIn practical terms, multi-agent systems could transform how we use AI in large organizations\nor even in daily life. We might have an ensemble of specialized agents: one monitors news and\ndata feeds, another manages your personal schedule, another handles creative brainstorming for\nyour projects, and they talk to each other when needed. Enterprises are looking at multi-agent\necosystems where, say, a finance analysis agent, a marketing data agent, and an IT automation\nagent could interoperate to drive business processes end-to-end. Google’s recent announcement\nof the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol highlights this vision: it emphasizes enabling agents \"to\ncollaborate in a dynamic, multi-agent ecosystem across siloed data systems and applications\"\nand to interoperate even if built by different vendors [17]. In such an ecosystem, one agent could\ncall upon another as a tool (e.g., a customer support agent hands off a complex technical query\nto a troubleshooting agent), or they might form a sequence (output of one is input to another).\nRealizing this smoothly will require common standards for agent communication and trust –\nprecisely the type of infrastructure Coral Protocol aims to provide.\n2.6 Multi AI Agent Collaboration\nSeveral proof-of-concept systems have explored multi-agent collaboration. The CAMEL frame-\nwork (2023) showed that two LLM agents can role-play as a \"user\" and an \"assistant\" to iteratively\nsolve a task together, essentially allowing the AI to have a conversation with itself from different\nperspectives to refine a solution. Microsoft’sAutoGen [21] provides a programming framework\nfor composing *conversational* interactions among multiple agents (and humans), so that one\ncan build execution plans where agents ask each other for help [21]. For instance, one agent could\nbe tasked with decomposing a problem into steps, then delegating each step to other specialized\nagents, and finally aggregating the results. Experiments with AutoGen found that such setups\ncan handle complex queries in domains like coding or decision-making more effectively than a\nsingle agent working alone [21]. Another striking example is theGenerative Agentssimulation\nmentioned earlier, where 25 agents inhabited a small virtual town – here the focus was on agents\nhaving social interactions with each other (e.g. sharing information, forming plans to organize\na party) and it demonstrated that coherent multi-agent dynamics can emerge from relatively\nsimple principles plus consistent language-model reasoning [16].\nThat said, coordinating multiple autonomous agents also introduces challenges. Without\ncareful design, multiple agents could talk in circles, misinform each other, or work at cross\npurposes. There are open questions in research aboutcoordination strategies(how do agents\nreach consensus or allocate tasks among themselves?) andcommunication protocols(what\nlanguage or format should agents use to exchange information efficiently and without ambiguity?).\nEarlier multi-agent systems research introduced languages like KQML and frameworks like FIPA-\nACL for agent communication, but those were largely pre-LLM and used in constrained settings.\nNow, with language-capable agents, one straightforward approach is to have them communicate\nin natural language (which is what many current experiments do, essentially having the agents\n\"chat\" with each other in English). This is flexible and leverages LLM strengths, but might be\ninefficient or prone to misunderstanding without some structure.\nThis is where an interoperability framework becomes crucial: it can provide a structured\nmedium for agent interaction (e.g., a shared memory or a common set of message types).

In summary,\nmulti-agent AI systems are an exciting and fast-evolving area — moving from single, siloed\nAI assistants towardsnetworks of cooperating agents. The recent progress in this domain\n(just in the past couple of years) underscores the need for interoperability solutions: to manage\ncomplexity, avoid reinventing integration logic, and unlock the full potential of collective AI\nintelligence. Coral Protocol’s goal of facilitating agent interoperability directly addresses this\nneed, aiming to enable robust, framework-agnostic collaboration among AI agents in the coming\n\"society of AI agents.\"\n2.7 Agent Communication Languages\nIn the early development of multi-agent systems, researchers designed specialized agent commu-\nnication languages to enable structured information exchange between autonomous agents. Two\npivotal examples were KQML (Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language) and the FIPA\nAgent Communication Language (ACL). KQML, introduced in the 1990s as part of DARPA’s\nKnowledge Sharing Effort [4], defined a high-level message format and protocol for agents to\nshare knowledge independent of any specific ontology or transport. It centered on an extensible\nset of message “performatives” (such as ask, tell, achieve, etc.) that represent different types of\nspeech acts an agent can perform. Following KQML, the Foundation for Intelligent Physical\nAgents (FIPA) – an international standards body founded in 1996 – sought to build on these\nideas and address some of KQML’s limitations around semantic rigor and standardization [5].\nFIPA defined an Agent Communication Language (ACL) that became a widely recognized\nstandard in academic agent research. FIPA-ACL preserved the use of performatives (e.g. inform,\nrequest, confirm, etc.) but provided a more formally defined core ontology and semantics for\nthem. This approach, inspired byspeech-act theory, provided a rigorous way to reason about\nconversations between agents and was important for research on negotiation, cooperation, and\ncoordination in multi-agent systems. The strengths of FIPA-ACL included this formal semantics\nand a comprehensive framework of interaction protocols (e.g. for contract-net bidding, auctions,\nquery-ref, etc.), which gave developers a blueprint for implementing complex dialogues.\nDespite their conceptual elegance and influence on academic research, neither KQML nor\nFIPA-ACL achieved widespread adoption in today’s LLM-based agent ecosystems. Limitations\nbecame apparent. KQML, while flexible, never fully specified the semantics of its performatives,\nleading to inconsistencies in how different implementations interpreted messages. FIPA-ACL,\non the other hand, was more tightly specified but also more complex: it required developers\nto commit to a particular set of interaction semantics (the mental-state model) that could be\ndifficult to verify in practice (since one cannot directly inspect another agent’s “beliefs”). Both\nframeworks assumed agents would share common ontologies and trust the communicated mental\nattitudes, assumptions that are hard to guarantee in open systems. Moreover, the infrastructure\nenvisioned by FIPA (with directory services, agent management systems, etc.) introduced\noverhead that, outside of research testbeds, proved cumbersome. By the mid-2000s, FIPA as an\norganization was dissolved without seeing broad industry uptake.\nIn the resurgence of AI agents driven by large language models, these older ACLs have\nnot been the foundation — modern agent developers often prefer lightweight JSON or natural-\nlanguage messaging over the formal, logic-based formats of KQML/FIPA. In summary, KQML\nand FIPA-ACL were critical steps in multi-agent system development, establishing the idea of\nstructured agent dialogues and common performatives. However, their formality and assumptions"}

By design, every transaction written to the chain is immutable and publicly\nverifiable, ensuring reliable auditability. In Coral Protocol, agent payments (and any inter-agent\ntransfers) are committed to the blockchain, creating an indelible audit trail of who paid whom\nand when. This means that all payments for services are transparently recorded and cannot be\nforged or altered after the fact.\nBeyond simple record-keeping, smart contracts encode the logic of payments and escrows\ndirectly on-chain. For example, an multi-agent application can publish a task as a smart contract\nthat holds funds in escrow: once the specified work is completed and verified, the contract\nautomatically releases payment to the agents. Such contracts allow conditional payments and\nautomated dispute resolution without centralized intermediaries. In practice this enables fine-\ngrained, trustless micropayments – agents can be compensated in real time for individual actions\nor API calls, and funds are only transferred when task conditions are met. These programmable\ncontracts ensure that incentives are aligned: agents are rewarded for correct behavior and cannot\nreceive payment without fulfilling their commitments.\nTogether, the blockchain and smart-contract layers create a fully decentralized trust model\nfor Coral. Users and agents need not trust any single party; instead, they rely on the blockchain’s\nconsensus mechanisms and cryptographic guarantees. Every payment is signed and timestamped\non chain, so any agent or user can audit the history of transactions on demand. In effect,\nCoral’s Secure Paymentsservice uses the blockchain as a backbone for the agent-economy:\nit ensures that all transfers are authorized, transparent, and tamper-proof. This underpins an\nopen marketplace of agent services where developers can list capabilities and set fees, and clients\ncan purchase those services via on-chain transactions. By recording all payments on a public\nledger, Coral aligns agents’ incentives (they earn tokens for useful work) and enables flexible,\ndecentralized commerce among agents without relying on traditional financial intermediaries.\nJuly 18, 2025 Page 12"}

Across the\nInternet, countless AI agents, often developed by different entities, are already analyzing data,\nmaking decisions, and transacting value independently. Yet, most of them operate in isolation,\noften without mutual trust or a shared understanding.\nNow consider the possibilities when these AI agents—each specialized, decentralized, and\nautonomous—collaborate to break down intricate tasks into manageable components. This\nshowcases the true potential of coordinated AI systems. Your AI agent could fulfill complex\nrequests by orchestrating a network of agents in real time, negotiating smart contracts across\nmultiple platforms, or collaboratively managing tasks to deliver a unified outcome. The potential\nis staggering: a distributed intelligence capable of solving complex, multi-dimensional problems\nmore rapidly and efficiently than any single agent or system alone.\nImagine, for example, spinning up an army of domain-expert AIs as easily as opening an app.\nA developer commits code and, without lifting a finger, a Git-Diff Reviewer triggers a whole\nrelay: pen-testing, architectural refactoring, unit-test regeneration, performance and accessibility\nsweeps—the green constellation on the left hums along until every check is green. Across the\nhall, a hackathon organiser watches a red cluster come alive: an Event Planner talks to an\nElizaOS concierge, schedules judges, provisions venues and even fires up an autonomous Event\nRunner while a friendly UI keeps humans in the loop. Meanwhile the blue B2B-sales galaxy is\nharvesting leads—in seconds a Deep Researcher, LinkedIn Outreach bot, HubSpot connector\nand Account-Manager chain track prospects from first touch to closed deal.\nEach AI agent acts independently but in collaboration with others, forming an adaptive,\nintelligent network capable of dynamic, real-time problem solving. But such a vision hinges on a\ncritical foundation: trust.\nTo realize this scenario, we need more than just smart algorithms—we need atrustworthy\nAI agent communication infrastructure. One where identity is verifiable, intentions are\nauditable, and interactions are secure and reliable. Only then can we unlock the full potential of\nmulti-agent collaboration on the open Internet and redefine how intelligence is distributed and\ncoordinated at scale.\n3.1 Rising AI Agent Communication Protocols\nAs AI agents have re-emerged via large language models and tool-using assistants, a number\nof modern communication protocols are being proposed to facilitate agent interaction. These\nefforts are motivated by the need to connect agents with data sources, other agents, and services\nin a standardized way — addressing the shortcomings of both ad-hoc integrations and the older\nACLs. Three notable emerging protocols are the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, the Agent\nNetwork Protocol (ANP), and AGNTCY’s suite of standards. Each takes a distinct approach to\nagent communication and coordination, and each illustrates both new capabilities and remaining\nchallenges in this space.\n3.1.1 Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol\nGoogle introduced the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, an open, vendor-neutral standard\ndesigned to enable seamless communication and collaboration among AI agents across various\nplatforms and ecosystems [18]. A2A focuses on task-oriented interactions, providing standardized\ntask objects with clearly defined lifecycles, and supporting the exchange of task-related artifacts\nto facilitate collaborative task executions. Built on established web standards like HTTP, JSON-\nRPC, and Server-Sent Events (SSE), the protocol ensures compatibility with existing technologies\nwhile offering enterprise-grade security through robust authentication and authorization aligned\nJuly 18, 2025 Page 13"}

Additionally, A2A supports dynamic discovery of agent capabilities via JSON-\nbased \"agent cards\" and handles both short-term tasks and long-running processes with real-time\nfeedback. Google’s collaboration with over 50 industry partners—including Salesforce, SAP,\nand Workday—highlights the broad industry commitment toward achieving standardized agent\ninteroperability.\nIn practice, A2A is poised to facilitate complex task executions in both enterprise and open-\nsource contexts. In enterprises, multiple AI agents could coordinate processes across business\nplatforms that typically don’t talk to each other today. For example, an agent integrated with a\nCRM like Salesforce might invoke another agent on an ERP system such as SAP to automatically\nfulfill an order or update financial records [6]. Organizations are exploring scenarios like a sales\nassistant agent requesting a finance agent to generate a pricing quote, or a customer support\nchatbot querying an inventory management agent for stock availability – all through A2A’s\nstandardized agent-to-agent calls without human middleware [8]. Because A2A is an open\nand framework-neutral protocol, it also lends itself to open-source innovation. Developers and\nresearchers can orchestrate modular AI agents (for instance, linking a data analysis agent with a\nvisualization agent) using A2A as the lingua franca for inter-agent dialogue. Indeed, popular\ntoolkits like LangChain have begun integrating A2A, allowing independent or specialized agents\nto be composed into larger AI workflows in research and development settings.\nDespite its promise, the A2A protocol has some limitations that motivate the development\nof more comprehensive multi-agent frameworks. Notably, A2A focuses on the mechanics of\nmessaging and doesn’t define a shared ontology or common knowledge base for semantics –\nagents still must understand the content of messages (often plain text or JSON) based on\ntheir own models or agreements, which can limit out-of-the-box interoperability in complex\ndomains. The protocol is also in an early stage (initially released as a draft specification in\n2025), so its extensibility to all possible use cases is still evolving and industry adoption is just\nbeginning. Moreover, A2A by itself addresses communication rather than higher-level cognition\nor coordination among agents. It enables agents to talk but does not inherently provide collective\nplanning, sophisticated negotiation, or “hive-mind” reasoning capabilities. Implementing such\nintelligence requires additional layers on top of A2A – for example, orchestration frameworks like\nGoogle’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) are intended to manage task executions and decision\nlogic among multiple agents using the A2A channel. In summary, A2A lays an important\nfoundation for agent interoperability, but it remains a low-level protocol; achieving robust\nmulti-agent collaboration will also require tackling semantic standards, advanced coordination\nstrategies, and other gaps that A2A alone does not fill.\n3.1.2 Agent Network Protocol (ANP)\nAgent Network Protocol (ANP) aims to become the “HTTP of the agentic web”, explicitly\nfocusing on agent-to-agent communication in a decentralized network. The design of ANP\nenvisions a future where potentially billions of AI agents (from personal assistants to autonomous\nservices) can find each other and exchange messages over the internet just as web services do today.\nTo enable this, ANP provides a multi-layered protocol stack: an identity and authentication layer\nbased on decentralized identifiers (DID) for registering agent identities and establishing end-to-\nend encrypted channels; a meta-protocol layer that lets agents negotiate which communication\nprotocols or interaction patterns to use with each other dynamically; and an application layer\ndescribing the semantics of messages (e.g. agent capabilities, message types, task descriptions)\nin a standard way."}

Early development of ANP\nhas produced specifications and reference implementations for key pieces, such as an Agent\nDiscovery Protocol and an Agent Description format, and the project has drawn interest in\nforums like the W3C WebAgents Community Group. The strength of ANP is its ambitious scope:\nit is explicitly trying to solve inter-agent networking in a general, open way, addressing trust\n(through decentralized identity and encryption) and scalability (through a common protocol\nthat any platform can implement). By treating agent communication as a first-class internet\nprotocol, ANP is tackling the harder problem of enabling heterogeneous agents to cooperate\nacross organizational boundaries, not just within a single product’s ecosystem.\nNevertheless, ANP is still in its early stages. Its limitations include the lack of a universally\naccepted “content language” or ontology for agent messages – while it might standardize the\nenvelopes and routing, agents still need to understand each other’s content (goals, plans, data\nformats), which is an open challenge. There is also a question of adoption and interoperability:\nfor ANP to succeed as an “industry standard,” it needs many independent agent frameworks\nto agree on using it. As of now, it remains a promising proposal; it provides pieces of the\npuzzle (identity, discovery, security), but extensibility and coordination logic are still evolving.\nAgents using ANP would still need higher-level conventions (negotiation protocols, coordination\nstrategies) defined on top of the base messaging, which are not fully unified. These gaps\nunderscore why new efforts continue to appear – the community recognizes the need for more\nthan just a transport, but a common understanding for agent collaboration.\n3.1.3 AGNTCY (Internet of Agents Initiative)\nAnother major initiative gaining traction (launched in late 2024) is AGNTCY – a coalition-driven\neffort by organizations including Cisco, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Galileo, and others to create\nan open standard for AI agent interoperability. AGNTCY is often described as laying the\nfoundation for an “Internet of Agents,” drawing a parallel to how early internet standards like\nTCP/IP and DNS connected disparate systems. The design of AGNTCY actually encompasses\nmultiple complementary protocols and frameworks. At its core are two key specifications: the\nOpen Agent Schema Framework (OASF) and the Agent Connect Protocol (ACP). OASF is\nessentially a standard schema or metadata format for describing agents – it defines how an agent\ncan publish its capabilities, interfaces, and other characteristics in a machine-readable way. This\nis crucial for agent discovery and evaluation: if all agents describe themselves using OASF, then\na directory or search mechanism can allow agents (or humans) to find suitable agents for a given\ntask and understand how to interact with them. On the other hand, ACP is the communication\nprotocol that allows agents to invoke and interact with each other once they’ve discovered each\nother. It covers establishing connections, authentication/authorization handshakes, exchanging\nmessages or task instructions, and handling errors in a standardized way – effectively, ACP\naims to let an agent built on one framework “call” an agent built on another, as seamlessly as a\nfunction call or API request.\nTogether, these pieces enable what AGNTCY envisions: for example, an organization could\ndeploy multiple AI agents with different specialties (say, an HR assistant, a coder agent, and\na data analyst agent) and, using AGNTCY standards, have them discover each other, share\ntasks, and coordinate task executions even if they were built by different vendors.

In terms of limitations,\nAGNTCY’s challenges echo those of any nascent standard: it currently lacks widespread\nimplementation, and there is a risk of competing protocols (like those above) dividing the\ncommunity. The effort needs to onboard many AI platforms and toolmakers to truly become the\n“standard” – in other words, it faces an uphill battle for critical mass, where if not enough parties\nadopt it, the goal of universal agent interoperability could fail due to multiple incompatible\necosystems. Additionally, while AGNTCY covers discovery and connection, it is still developing\nthe full “coordination logic” for complex task exeuctions (their roadmap includes stages for\norchestration and monitoring of multi-agent systems). This means that questions of how agents\nplan joint tasks, agree on protocols for negotiation, or maintain long-term collaborations may\nrequire further conventions on top of AGNTCY’s base layer.\n3.1.4 NANDA (Networked Agents and Decentralized AI)\nNANDA is an MIT Media Lab initiative that envisions an “Internet of AI Agents” – a global,\ndecentralized network where agents can discover, communicate, and transact autonomously.\nArchitecturally, NANDA is described as a “rules-based operating system for agents”. It employs\na multi-layered protocol stack built on existing standards (e.g. Anthropic’s Model Context\nProtocol) and adds comprehensive identity, discovery, and trust mechanisms. For example,\nagents register themselves in decentralized registries and are authenticated by cryptographic\ncertificates. NANDA integrates identity management, verifiability, and portable reputation\nwithin the protocol so that any agent’s identity and track record can be verified by others. In this\nway, agents can self-register and discover each other’s capabilities without a central authority,\nand then establish secure, end-to-end communication channels for coordination.\nNANDA’s core goals include secure multi-agent coordination and composability. It provides\nstandard data schemas and message formats so that agents from different domains can understand\none another. Agents describe their capabilities via a common schema framework, much like\na machine-readable profile, and then use NANDA’s protocols to invoke and integrate those\ncapabilities. For instance, an agent can query a registry to find specialist agents, then invoke them\nin sequence to complete a complex task. Security and accountability are built in: interactions\nand agreements can be enforced via cryptographic proofs, and an agent’s portable reputation\ntoken accrues across transactions. In effect, NANDA turns every API or data service into an\ninteractive network participant with verifiable identity, enabling agents to compose arbitrary\nservices into workflows in a trust-minimized environment.\nCompared with Coral, NANDA takes a more “full-stack” approach to interoperability. Both\nsystems aim to let heterogeneous agents work together, but they emphasize different layers.\nCoral Protocol relies on the Open Agent Schema Framework (OASF) and the Agent Connect\nProtocol (ACP) to define a uniform way for agents to publish capabilities and call one another’s\ninterfaces. In Coral, any agent that implements the standard schemas can be invoked like an\nAPI, and payments for services are handled via the blockchain. NANDA, by contrast, embeds\nadditional layers into the fabric of the network: it assumes built-in decentralized discovery,\nidentity and reputation layers, and even governance protocols.

In early 2025 it introduced AgentWorks™, a suite of tools designed to let agents\noperate across enterprise boundaries. The suite includes services for identity (AgentID), discovery\n(Agent Registry), connectivity (AgentConnect), and digital wallets, but its core is the AgentTalk\nprotocol – a patented, extensible agent-to-agent messaging and transaction layer. Synergetics\nenvisions giving every agent a verifiable identity (for example using a “.TWIN” blockchain\ndomain as a wallet) so that agents can authenticate and transact without human intervention.\nThe design goals of Synergetics emphasize security, interoperability, and decentralized trust.\nAgents created on the platform are provisioned with cryptographic IDs (AgentID) and zero-\nknowledge proof credentials to enable Know-Your-Agent (KYA) verification. Communications\nover AgentTalk are end-to-end encrypted, and transactions between agents (such as service\npurchases or data exchanges) can be anchored on blockchain using smart contracts. In practice,\nSynergetics provides a layered stack: for example, AgentRegistry handles discovery and trust,\nAgentWallet manages keys and tokens, and AgentConnect bridges agents to web and metaverse\nenvironments. According to Synergetics, its AgentTalk protocol (also referred to in their\narchitecture discussions as “AgentFlow”) handles real-time, asynchronous inter-agent messaging\nand workflow coordination. This approach is akin to an OSI-inspired model: lower layers ensure\ntransport and identity, while the AgentTalk/AgentFlow layer provides a common “language”\nand control structure for agents to negotiate tasks.\nSynergetics’s platform exhibits several notable strengths. By integrating identity, registry,\ncommunication, and even a marketplace (AgentMarket) under one framework, it ensures full\ntraceability and security of agent interactions. Every agent effectively has a “passport” (the\n.TWIN DNS name) and a built-in digital wallet, which enables secure transactions and ownership\nof AI assets. The use of blockchain and tokenization is innovative: for example, Synergetics\ntouts that agents can be listed, bought, or subscribed to on an open marketplace, with royalties\nand subscriptions enforced on-chain. The platform explicitly targets interoperability (even\nwith embedded and physical agents) and real-time automation, as emphasized in its marketing\nmaterials. In short, Synergetics offers a practical, end-to-end agentic ecosystem where agents\ncan find each other, negotiate terms, and carry out complex workflows across organizations.\nHowever, Synergetics also has limitations. It is a single-vendor, proprietary system (with key\ntechnologies patented), so broad community-driven standardization is lacking. Adoption to date\nis still nascent, and integrating its blockchain-based identity stack could present performance\nor complexity challenges for some users. Like other early proposals, Synergetics prioritizes\ntransactional and identity layers; it does not itself define high-level semantics or reasoning\nontologies for agents, leaving rich multi-agent reasoning to be built on top. In practice, its focus\non market-driven agent capabilities (agents as products) means it may be less suited for purely\nacademic or open-source scenarios than consortium-led efforts.\nCompared to the other approaches discussed above, Synergetics overlaps with them in some\naspects but diverges in others. For example, Google’s A2A also standardizes messaging but\nlacks a built-in identity or economic layer – whereas Synergetics bakes both into its fabric. Like\nANP and NANDA, it employs decentralized identifiers and registries for agent discovery, but\nSynergetics ties them directly to blockchain DNS and wallets. Unlike the multi-organization"}

Rather than defining just a communication protocol, watsonx\nOrchestrator delivers an end-to-end environment to build, run and manage AI agents that can\ncollaborate across diverse business applications and data sources. Key capabilities announced\nin 2025 include a no-code Agent Builder (enabling custom AI agents to be created in under\nfive minutes) and an Agent Catalog listing over150 pre-built agents and tools from IBM and\npartners [7]. IBM provides domain-specialized agents (e.g. for HR, procurement, sales) with\nready-made skills, alongside utility agents for tasks like web research and calculations, to jump-\nstart common enterprise use cases [7]. These agents—and any custom or third-party agents—are\norchestrated through a unified interface, with a central AI-driven planner intelligently routing\ntasks to the appropriate agent, tool, or human stakeholder as needed. Powered by large language\nmodels (e.g. IBM’s Granite series) for reasoning and planning, the Orchestrator acts as a\n“multi-agent supervisor, router and planner,” autonomously coordinating agents to complete\ncomplex workflows while abstracting away the complexity for end users [7].\nA core strength of watsonx Orchestrator is its deep integration into enterprise IT ecosystems.\nThe platform comes pre-integrated with 80+ enterprise applications and services (Salesforce,\nSAP, Workday, Microsoft tools, etc.), allowing AI agents to directly interact with existing\nsoftware stacks for actions like database updates, form submissions, or ticket handling [7]. This\nout-of-the-box connectivity, combined with support for hybrid cloud and on-premise deployments,\nreflects IBM’s emphasis on immediate business value—agents can “plug into” legacy systems\nand cloud services without extensive custom integration. In contrast to pure protocol efforts,\nIBM’s solution provides built-in workflow orchestration: it not only enables messaging between\nagents but can automatically sequence multi-step processes (planning, invoking one agent after\nanother, aggregating results, handling exceptions) to fulfill a high-level task. Enterprise-grade\nfeatures such as agent observability and governance are also included [7]. For example, watsonx\nOrchestrator supplies monitoring dashboards and guardrails to track agent performance, data\nusage, and compliance, leveraging IBM’s AI governance frameworks for risk management. This\nfocus on management and oversight addresses concerns like reliability, security and accountability\nwhich are critical in corporate settings.\nAlthough IBM’s offering is a proprietary platform, it is designed with interoperability in mind.\nThe Orchestrator’s extensible architecture allows agents built on various frameworks (including\nopen-source agent libraries like LangChain, LangGraph, etc.) to be onboarded via standardized\ninterfaces. IBM has introduced anAgent Connectdeveloper framework that exposes familiar\nREST/JSON and chat-based APIs for external agents to communicate within the Orchestrator\nenvironment. Notably, watsonx Orchestrator also embraces emerging agent communication\nstandards: it supports Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool and data access\ninteroperability, and IBM has open-sourced anAgent Collaboration Protocol (ACP)to facilitate\nagent-to-agent messaging within its ecosystem [7]. By aligning with standards like MCP (and\npotentially bridging to protocols like A2A), IBM aims to avoid isolating its agents from the wider\n“internet of agents.” In essence, the platform implements a superset of agent communication\nfunctionality — a practical application layer that sits atop low-level protocols, abstracting them\ninto a cohesive workflow engine.\n3.2 Why Coral Protocol?\nThe AI-agent ecosystem is rapidly diversifying.

Meanwhile, consortium efforts such as Cisco’s AGNTCY and MIT’s NANDA\noutline ambitious blueprints for a decentralizedInternet of Agents, and commercial stacks like\nSynergetics.ai add wallet-centric marketplaces.\nYet each of these initiatives addresses only a slice of the full problem space.\n• A2A excels at framework-agnostic message exchange but is point-to-point and leaves\nincentives and team logic to higher layers.\n• ANP provides strong DID-based identity and peer discovery, yet omits built-in payment\nrails or economic coordination.\n• IBM watsonx Orchestratoroffers AI-driven planning and governance dashboards, but—as\na proprietary platform—cannot guarantee vendor-neutral participation or tokenised incen-\ntives beyond IBM’s ecosystem.\n• AGNTCY and NANDA articulate open registries and governance but remain largely\nconceptual, with limited turnkey tooling for secure team assembly or on-chain value\ntransfer.\nCoral Protocolcloses these gaps by combining the strongest ideas from prior work into a\ncohesive, open stack:\n• Vendor-neutral interoperability and extensibility.

Through these\ncoralisers, developers effectively “Coralise” their models, data, or agents — registering them into\nthe ecosystem so that they become available as Coralized AI Agents in the middle context. In\naddition to these, developers can utilizeOther Tools(e.g., software development kits, testing\nframeworks, or monitoring dashboards provided by the Coral platform) to build, debug, and\noptimize their agents and integrations.\nEnd-users in this context are the consumers of the AI agent services. They interact with\nCoralized AI Agents by issuing natural language queries or commands through user-facing\napplications or interfaces built on top of Coral Protocol. Users need not be aware of the\nunderlying complexity; they simply pose questions or tasks in everyday language. For instance,\na user might ask, “What does AgentX think about hypothesisY?” or instruct the system with\na command like, “Pay@AgentZ $50 to investigate the total area of region R.” These inputs\nfrom users enter the Coral ecosystem via the Interaction Mediation service of Coral Protocol\n(described later), which ensures the queries are routed appropriately. In summary, the Developers\nand Users context supplies the ecosystem with integrated AI capabilities (via coralizers) and the\ndriving queries or tasks (from users) that initiate agent interactions.\n4.2 Coralised AI Agents\nThe middle tier of the architecture consists of the Coralised AI Agents — the ensemble of AI\nservices and agents that have been onboarded into the ecosystem and operate under Coral’s\nframework. Each Coralised agent is an AI service (often backed by a large language model or\nspecialized AI module) that adheres to Coral Protocol for communication and security. Once\ndevelopers coralise a model, data source, or existing agent, it becomes a Coralised AI Agent\naccessible in this layer. Collectively, these agents form a distributed, interoperable multi-agent\nsystem, each capable of understanding and responding to natural language prompts.\nWhen an end-user query or command enters the system (for example, the questions or\ninstructions mentioned above), Coral Protocol’s Interaction Mediation component will dispatch\nit to the appropriate agent or agents in this layer. An agent specialized in a certain domain (say,\nAgent X in the earlier query) will receive the question directed at it and generate a response\ndrawing on its knowledge or data (which might have been linked via a Data Coralizer). Coralized\nagents can also initiate interactions with one another under guidance of Coral Protocol. For\ninstance, if a user’s request is complex and requires multiple skills, Coral Protocol can intelligently\nform a dedicated team by discovering and composing the necessary AI agent together. All\nsuch inter-agent dialogues are mediated and logged by the protocol to maintain coherence and\nsecurity.\nCrucially, Coralized AI Agents can handle not only informational queries but also procedural\ncommands that involve actions in the ecosystem. For example, when a user says “Pay@AgentZ\n$50 to perform task T,” the addressed agent (Agent Z) will be invoked to execute the task\nT, and Coral Protocol will engage its secure payment service to transfer the specified amount.\nThroughout their operation, coralized agents remain decoupled from any particular user interface\nor platform — they rely on Coral Protocol to handle incoming requests, outgoing replies, and any\ncoordination with other services. This design allows a heterogeneous collection of AI agents to\nwork together seamlessly: each agent focuses on its specialized processing (e.g., analyzing data,\nanswering questions, performing computations), while the protocol manages communications and\nshared context. The result is a flexible multi-agent ecosystem where, from the user’s perspective,"}

It\ncomprises two main parts: a set of coreCoral Servicesthat mediate and secure the ecosystem’s\noperations, and the Deployment and infrastructure layer that supports these services. An\nimportant additional concept in this context isSecure Team Formation, which refers to the\nprotocol’s capability to dynamically assemble multiple agents into collaborative task teams in a\nsecure manner. We describe each of these aspects below.\n4.3.1 Coral Services\nCoral Protocol offers several key services to orchestrate interactions:\n1. InteractionMediation isresponsibleforroutingandmanagingallmessagesbetweenusers\nand agents (and between agents themselves). It receives user queries or commands from\nthe interface and determines which Coralized AI agent(s) should handle them, forwarding\nthe query along with any relevant context. It also ensures that responses or follow-up\nquestions from agents are delivered to the right recipients (e.g. back to the user or to\nanother agent), maintaining the dialogue state.\n2. Secure Paymentshandles monetary transactions and incentives within the ecosystem.\nWhen a user’s instruction includes a payment (such as paying an agent for a service), this\nservice securely executes the transaction, escrow if necessary, and confirms the payment\nusing the underlying blockchain. It ensures that financial exchanges between users and\nagents (or between agents) are authorized and recorded, enabling a marketplace of agent\nservices.\n3. Task Managementoversees the life-cycle of complex tasks that agents undertake. It\nassigns or schedules the sub-tasks to the appropriate agents, monitors their progress,\nand aggregates results. For example, if a user’s query spawns a multi-step research task\ninvolving several agents, the Task Management service will track each step and ensure the\noverall task completes successfully.\n4. Secure Multi-Agent Teamworkcoordinates scenarios where multiple AI agents collab-\norate on a shared objective. This service sets up and manages the team of information and\ncontrol between agents, enforcing security policies such as authentication of each agent’s\nidentity and permissions. It ensures that agents exchange data through approved channels\nand that the execution follows any constraints (for instance, not revealing sensitive data\nto an agent lacking clearance). Together, these Coral services form the intelligent control\nplane of the ecosystem, mediating every interaction to guarantee it is executed efficiently\nand safely.\n4.3.2 Deployment Infrastructure\nTo support the above services and the execution of AI agents, Coral Protocol leverages a\ndistributed deployment infrastructure. A network of MCP Servers hosts the AI models\nand agent runtimes. “MCP” refers to the Model Context Protocol – a standardized interface\nthat these servers implement to allow agents to request model inference or tool usage with\na unified API. By deploying agents on MCP servers, Coral ensures that each agent can be\ninvoked remotely with proper context and resource allocation, abstracting away the hardware\nor environment details. These servers handle the heavy computation of AI tasks (such as\nrunning large language model inferences or data processing jobs) and expose endpoints for the\nInteraction Mediation service to call. In parallel, the Coral ecosystem integrates ablockchain\nJuly 18, 2025 Page 22"}

The blockchain serves as a secure ledger for recording important\nevents and transactions: it records payment transactions issued via the Secure Payments service,\nand can also log multi-agent agreements or task completion records for auditability. By using\nblockchain technology, Coral introduces an immutable and transparent layer of trust – for\nexample, users and developers can verify that an agent was indeed paid for its service, or that\na particular multi-agent task’s outcome was agreed upon by all parties. The blockchain also\naids in decentralized governance of the ecosystem, ensuring no single party can tamper with the\nhistory of agent interactions or outcomes.\n4.3.3 Secure Team Formation\nAn advanced feature of Coral Protocol is its support for secure team formation, which is the\ndynamic assembly of multiple agents into a collaborative team to solve complex tasks. When\nInteraction Mediation and Task Management determine that a user’s request requires diverse\nexpertise (for instance, a task needs one agent to gather data, another to analyze it, and another\nto verify the results), the protocol initiates secure team formation. This process involves selecting\nthe appropriate set of Coralized AI Agents, establishing authenticated communication channels\namong them, and defining each agent’s role in the complex task. TheSecure Multi-Agent Team\nand blockchain infrastructure play pivotal roles here: each agent’s identity and permissions can be\nverified against blockchain records or certificates, and any inter-agent contracts (such as payment\nsplits or data access agreements) can be codified as smart contracts or logged transactions.\nThe result is a trusted ad-hoc team of AI agents that can cooperatively work on the user’s\ntask. Throughout the team’s operation, the Coral services enforce that information sharing is\nrestricted to what is necessary for the task and that any interim results are reported back to the\nTask Management module. Once the collaborative task is complete, the team can be disbanded,\nwith the outcome delivered to the user as a coherent result. Secure team formation thus enables\nscalability of problem-solving: the ecosystem can marshal multiple specialized agents together,\nwhile maintaining security and trust among agents that may have been contributed by different\ndevelopers or organizations.\n4.4 Inter-Context Data Flow and Interaction\nBringing together the above elements, the data flow in the Coral ecosystem moves fluidly across\nthe three contexts under the governance of Coral Protocol. A typical interaction begins with\nan end-user query or command from the Developers/Users context. This request enters Coral\nProtocol, which uses its Interaction Mediation service to interpret and route the request to one\nor more Coralized AI Agents. Those agents, running on MCP Server infrastructure, receive\nthe query along with any additional context or data provided (possibly accessing external data\nthrough integrated sources via Data Coralizers).\nAs the agents process the query, they may perform computations, look up information,\nor even generate sub-queries to other agents. Any such agent-to-agent interactions are again\nmanaged by the protocol’s services. If the user’s request entails a transactional component (e.g.,\npaying an agent or purchasing data), the Secure Payments service engages with the blockchain\nto execute and record the transaction, ensuring the agent proceeds with the task once payment\nis confirmed. For complex requests, the Task Management service may split the work among\nmultiple agents and invoke secure team formation to coordinate them. Intermediate results flow\nback through the Task Management and Interaction Mediation layers, which assemble the final\nanswer or result.\nFinally, the response is delivered back to the end-user, completing the round-trip.

At a high level, user applications and developer\ntooling (top layer) interact with Coral Servers on each host, which in turn coordinate Coralized\nAgents (middle layer) running on distributed compute servers. These components communicate\nover the Internet and record trust-critical events on a common blockchain (bottom layer).\nTogether, this architecture ensures that agents “wrapped” for Coral (the Coralized Agents) can\nbe invoked and orchestrated in a uniform, secure manner.\nFigure 2: Coral Protocol Architecture\nThearchitecturediagramofCoralProtocolisshowninFigure2. Therearemultiplecomputers\n(nodes) running Coral Servers, each hosting Coralized Agents, MCP servers, development tools,\nand wallets, all connected via the Internet and secured by an underlying blockchain.\n5.2 Coralized Agents\nThe Coralised Agents reside in the middle tier of the architecture and are the core AI services of\nthe system. Each Coralised Agent is an AI module or service (often backed by a large language\nmodel or specialized analytics tool) that has been onboarded to comply with Coral’s protocols\n(see Section 4.2). Once a model or data source is coralised, it becomes a first-class agent in the\necosystem. Collectively, these agents form a distributed, interoperable multi-agent system that\ncan understand natural-language queries and perform tasks. When a user request or command\narrives (via a user’s application), the Coral Server’s Interaction Mediation service dispatches the\nquery to the appropriate Coralised Agent(s). For example, a query directed at “Agent X” is\nrouted to that agent’s instance, which then processes the query and generates a response using\nits internal knowledge or tools. Coralised Agents can also communicate with one another (e.g.,\nto handle sub-tasks in a complex task execution) under the coordination of Coral Protocol’s\nmulti-agent teamwork services. In summary, the Coralised Agents layer encapsulates all AI\nservices in the ecosystem, enabling them to interoperate seamlessly (see Section 4.2).\n5.3 MCP Servers and Tools\nThe MCP Servers and Tools layer provides the compute and integration endpoints that Coralized\nAgents use to perform tasks.

In practice, each agent\nis deployed as a service on one or more MCP servers. A network of MCP servers hosts AI model\nruntimes and heavy computation back-ends, exposing them through a standardized API. For\ninstance, an MCP server might run a large language model or a data-processing pipeline; Coral\nProtocol can invoke it remotely via the MCP interface. Notably, MCP supports not just model\ninference but also tool usage: agents can request to use external tools (APIs, databases, web\nsearch, etc.) through the same MCP API. In effect, “tools” in the diagram refers to additional\nfunctionalities or APIs that agents can call. By abstracting hardware and environment details,\nMCP servers ensure that any Coralized Agent can run anywhere in the network with proper\ncontext and resources. In short, the MCP Servers and Tools layer supplies the underlying AI\nmodels and function endpoints that agents use to generate intelligent results.\nEach node also includes a Wallet component to support secure economic transactions. Coral’s\nbuilt-in Secure Payments service (Section 4.3.1) enables users and agents to exchange payments\nfor services, and this requires wallet accounts. A wallet holds the cryptographic keys and token\nbalance for a user or agent. When an agent completes a paid task, the Secure Payments service\nuses the wallet to sign and broadcast a blockchain transaction; similarly, users’ wallets are\ndebited when they request a paid service. By tying payments to wallets, the protocol ensures\nthat every financial exchange is authorized and recorded. In the architecture diagram, the\n“Wallets” box under each agent/MCP server indicates that each agent (and user interface) has\nan associated wallet address. These wallets interface directly with the Coral Server’s payment\nlogic and the blockchain layer, so that statements like “Pay @AgentZ $50” in a user’s query can\nbe carried out via smart contract or transaction.\n5.4 Coral Server\nThe Coral Server is the local host process on each computer that implements the core Coral\nprotocol services (Section 4.3.1). In the diagram, each node’s large block labeled “Coral Server”\ncontains these services. The Coral Server listens for incoming requests from user apps or other\nagents and uses the Interaction Mediation service to manage messagethreads. For example, in a\nconversation thread, it creates threads, adds participants (agents), and delivers messages (as\nseen in example in Section 9).\nInternally, the Coral Server also invokes the Task Management service to decompose complex\njobs into sub-tasks, and the Secure Multi-Agent Teamwork to coordinate inter-agent protocols.\nIf a transaction is involved, the Coral Server triggers the Secure Payments service to engage\nwith the blockchain. In effect, the Coral Server is the control-plane nexus that ties user queries\nto agent actions: it routes inputs to the correct Coralised Agents, aggregates their outputs, and\nenforces security and workflow policies as described in Section 4.3.1.\n5.5 Multi-Agent Application\nThe Multi-Agent Application layer sits atop Coral Protocol on the developer’s computer. This is\nthe developer’s or end-user’s application that uses Coral’s APIs to create and orchestrate agents.\nTypically, the application will instantiate one or more “UI agents” or orchestrator agents that\ninterface with the human. For example, a UI agent can receive a user’s command (“Compute X\nfor me”) and call the Coral Server to create a new task thread mentioning the required agents.\nAs discussed in Section 4.1, developers use Coralizer modules and SDKs (under Tools) to\nintegrate their agents into this application layer. Once a conversation thread is established, the\napplication will relay the user’s natural-language query into Coral’s Interaction Mediation, and\nlater collect the agents’ replies to present back to the user.

Coral is inherently network-agnostic: Coral Servers, agents, and\nMCP servers on different machines communicate over standard Internet protocols (e.g. HTTP\nor WebSockets).\nIn practice, a Coralized Agent running on one host can be invoked by a Coral Server on\nanother machine, as long as they are connected via the Internet. The Interaction Mediation\nservice abstracts these network links, so that sending a message to an agent transparently\ntraverses the Internet if needed. This layer ensures that no matter where developers deploy their\nagents or servers, the Coral architecture remains coherent. As summarized in Section 4.4, data\nflows “fluidly across the three contexts” over these network connections.\n5.7 Blockchain Layer\nFinally, the Blockchain Layer underpins the entire ecosystem. Coral integrates a blockchain\nnetwork into its deployment fabric (see Section 4.3.2) to provide an immutable ledger. All impor-\ntant events—such as secure payment transfers, agent agreements, or execution checkpoints—can\nbe logged on the blockchain. This means, for example, that every completed transaction or\nmulti-agent contract is recorded transparently: users and developers can later verify that a\npayment was made or a task was approved by all parties. Because the blockchain is decentralized,\nit guarantees that no single Coral participant can alter these records.\nIn Figure 2, the blockchain is shown as the foundation. In operation, whenever the Coral\nServer executes the Secure Payments service, it generates a signed transaction that is broadcast\nto this blockchain. The blockchain also supports the Secure Team Formation process by storing\nagent identities, permissions, or smart-contract bindings, thereby enforcing trust across different\norganizational domains.\nIn sum, the blockchain layer provides the trust and audit backbone for all Coral transactions\nand multi-agent tasks executions.\nJuly 18, 2025 Page 27"}

All interactions are governed by well-defined\nprotocols and interfaces, ensuring that agents remain loosely coupled yet interoperable within\nthe larger multi-agent system. In particular, communication is facilitated through standard\nweb mechanisms (HTTP, WebSocket) and event streams (Server-Sent Events), which provide a\nrobust, asynchronous messaging substrate. The following provides a detailed description of each\narchitectural element and their interplay in the Coralised Agent framework.\n6.1.1 AI Agent and Data Storage:\nAt the core of the architecture is the AI agent, the autonomous decision-making entity. This\nagent can be implemented using any suitable agent framework or language model platform (for\nexample, CrewAI or ElizaOS), and it embodies the logic for interpreting inputs, maintaining\nconversational context, and generating outputs. The agent is designed to operate independently,\nencapsulating its own goals and cognitive processes. To support long-term reasoning and context\nmanagement, the AI agent can be paired with an internaldata storagecomponent. This data\nstore (often a database or vector memory) can hold the agent’s knowledge base, conversation\nhistory, and any persistent state or embeddings needed for the agent’s tasks.

The AI agent can query and\nupdate this storage as it reasons, effectively using it as its memory. The agent does not directly\ninvoke other agents’ internals; instead, it interfaces with the outside world exclusively through\nthe standardized channels provided by the Coral framework, which preserves modularity and\nindependence across agents.\n6.1.2 Coral Server (Coral MCP Server)\nAt the center of the Coralised Agent framework is theCoral server, a dedicated server that\nenables multi-agent coordination and communication. For each AI agent, the Coral server\nimplements a specialized MCP server (the “Coral MCP server”) whose role is to facilitate\nagent-to-agent messaging through the notion ofthreads. A thread is a structured conversation\nchannel in which multiple agents (and potentially human users or other services) can participate.\nCoral MCP servers provide a suite of tools (accessible via SSE requests) that agents use to\nregister and interact within this multi-agent environment. These tools include core operations\nfor agent and thread management. Key tools exposed by the Coral MCP server are:\n• list_agents: Returns a list of all agents currently registered in the system, enabling\ndiscovery of potential collaborators or recipients of messages.\n• create_thread: Creates a new communication thread (conversation) and specifies an\ninitial set of participant agents. The thread functions as a context where messages are\nbroadcast to all its participants. Each thread is identified by an ID, and its state (messages\nexchanged, participants list, etc.) is tracked on the Coral server.\n• add_participant / remove_participant: Modifies the participant list of an existing\nthread, allowing agents to join or leave ongoing conversations. This is useful for dynamically\nbringing in new expertise (via another agent) or removing agents that are no longer needed\nin the discussion.\n• send_message: Transmits a message into a specified thread. The message typically contains\ncontent intended for one or more agents; it may include a direct mention (e.g., an @ tag\nor specific address) of a particular agent if a response from that agent is desired. When\nan agent invokessend_message, the Coral server appends the message to the thread’s\ntimeline and handles its propagation to participants.\n• wait_for_mentions: A blocking or subscription call that an agent uses to await any new\nmessages in threads that mention the agent (i.e. explicitly address it). This mechanism is\nhow an agent effectively “listens” for messages directed to it. Instead of the agent continu-\nously polling for new data, the Coral server will notify it when relevant communication\narrives.\n• close_thread: Terminates a thread, optionally recording a summary or final outcome.\nClosing a thread signals that the conversation has concluded; resources can be freed and\nno further messages will be exchanged in that context.\nThese tools collectively realize a flexible communication protocol for the “Internet of Agents” –\ntheyallowagentstodiscovereachother, formconversations, exchangeinformation, andcoordinate\nactions. Notably, the Coral server enforces structured messaging: messages are associated with\nthreads and annotated with sender and (optionally) mentioned recipient metadata. This design\nensures clarity in multi-party dialogues and allows the system to route messages appropriately\n(especially in directed queries or task delegations from one agent to another).

For example, when AgentA sends\na message in a thread mentioning AgentB, the server identifies that AgentB is referenced and\ngenerates an event to notify AgentB of the incoming message. This notification mechanism\nis central to how Coralised agents remain responsive to each other without continuous active\nquerying.\nIn addition to tools, each Coral MCP server incorporates a dedicated cryptographicwallet\nmodule. Within Coral Protocol’s design, this wallet underpins the trust and payment layer,\nenabling agents to engage in secure interactions. In the current implementation, however, the\nwallet is used only toreceive payments once a team task is successfully completed; agents do\nnot yet initiate outbound transfers or other on-chain operations. The operational details of these\npayment flows are presented in Section 8.\n6.1.3 MCP Servers\nThe AI agent’s capabilities can be augmented by using one or more (external)MCP servers. An\nMCP server provides a standardized interface for the agent to access external tools, services,\nand secure identity functions. Essentially, an MCP server acts as an intermediary that the AI\nagent calls when it needs to perform actions beyond its native reasoning scope.\nAn MCP server can host a suite of pluggable tools (e.g., external APIs, databases, com-\nputational utilities) that the agent can invoke in order to gather information or execute tasks.\nFor instance, an agent might call a web search API, a code execution sandbox, or a weather\nservice via these tool endpoints. By abstracting these capabilities behind a protocol, the agent\ncan leverage them simply by issuing a tool-use request (often formulated as a special command\nor function call in the agent’s output) which the MCP server interprets and executes. This\nmechanism effectively extends the agent’s functionality with external context and operations, as\nis the goal of MCP – to enhance an AI model with external data and services in a consistent\nmanner.\n6.2 Coralisation\nTo transform external MCP servers or AI agents into fully functional Coralised Agents, Coral\nProtocol provides modular adapters known asCoralisers. A Coraliser acts as an onboarding\nlayer, wrapping an external resource and exposing it via Coral Protocol using the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP). This process is called Coralisation. Coralisation allows previously\nsiloed resources to participate in Coral-mediated complex tasks, with full interoperability,\ndiscoverability, and optional monetization.\nCoralisation is categorized by the type of resource they integrate into the Coral ecosystem:\n• MCP Coralisation— Wrapping external MCP services or APIs into callable capabilities\nfor Coralised Agents.\n• AI Agent Coralisation— Onboarding legacy or third-party AI agents by mapping their\ninterfaces to Coral standards.\nEach type is described in detail below.\n6.2.1 MCP Coralisation\nMCP Coralisationintegrates external tools and APIs into the Coral ecosystem, enabling\nagents to invoke external services (e.g., simulations, transaction processors, APIs) as part of\nJuly 18, 2025 Page 30"}

These tools can perform computations, automate real-world effects, or\nserve as actuators for AI decision-making.\nFigure 4: Coralisation of an MCP Server\nMCP Coralisation wraps an outside MCP Server and translates its callable operations\n(e.g., \"simulate_market\", \"fetch_weather\", \"send_email\") into Coral’s standard messaging\nformat (e.g., HTTP, SSE6). Return values are reformatted into Coral-compatible responses,\noptionally including metadata about execution status, latency, or confidence. In effect, this\nprocess “coralises” a standalone MCP Server – turning it into a Coral-compatible agent that can\ncommunicate and collaborate with other agents in the ecosystem. Developers can achieve this\nsimply by providing a configuration for the target MCP server and running the Coraliser utility,\nwhich automates the entire setup. The Coraliser generates ready-to-run Coral agent code for\nthe external service, eliminating any need for custom wiring or complex integration code7.\nOnce an external service is coralised, it behaves like a native Coral agent. The Coraliser\nrepository, for example, demonstrates how to coralise a web-scraping service (Firecrawl MCP)\nand a code assistant service (GitHub MCP) into Coral agents. The process to coralise an external\nMCP server typically involves the following steps:\n• Configure the MCP endpoint: Add the external server’s connection details (API end-\npoint, keys, etc.) to the Coraliser settings (e.g. updating thecoraliser_settings.json\nfile for the target MCP).\n• Generate the Coral agent: Run the Coraliser tool, which validates connectivity and\nautomatically produces a new agent script for that MCP server. This script contains the\nlogic for translating Coral protocol messages to the external service’s API calls and vice\nversa.\n• Launch the agent in Coral: Execute the generated agent script to register the external\nservice as a Coral agent (for example, running pythonfirecrawl_coral_agent.py for a\nFirecrawl MCP). Once launched, the coralised agent connects to the Coral Server and is\nready to receive tasks from other agents, invoking the external service’s capabilities in\nresponse.\nMCP Coralisers play a crucial role in Coral Protocol ecosystem by providing a seamless\non-ramp for external AI functionalities.

This smart\ncontract architecture manages payments inSPL tokens(Solana’s token standard) and ensures\nfunds are held in escrow until predefined conditions are met. By leveraging Solana’s high-\nthroughput, low-cost infrastructure, Coral can handlefine-grained micropaymentsand rapid\nfund releases with minimal fees. The result is a robust, decentralised payment layer where\ncode-enforced rules guarantee that agents are paidonly when they fulfil agreed tasks, and\npayers’ funds remain secure until those conditions are satisfied.\nCoral is designed to support following multi-agent economic coordination:\n• Escrow Contracts (Live): For any multi-agent task, payments should be deposited\ninto an escrow smart contract before work begins. TheCoral escrow programholds\nthe funds in a securevault accountunder program control (see Algorithm 1). Funds\nremain locked until the contract’s release conditions are triggered – for example, when the\nrequester signals task completion or an autonomous verification is recorded. At that point,\nthe contractautomatically releases the paymentto the wallet of the fulfilment agent8.\nIf the conditions are not met (e.g., the task fails or a deadline passes), the contract can\nrefund the requester, eliminating counterparty risk without requiring any intermediaries.\nThis conditional escrow mechanism is enforced entirely by smart contract logic, making\nthe outcometrustless – neither party can unilaterally cheat or seize the funds.\nAll transactions in Coral’s payment system are recorded on Solana’simmutable public\nledger, providing fullauditabilityand accountability9. Every deposit, partial release, and final\ndisbursement is cryptographically signed and timestamped on-chain, allowing any participant\nto verify the history of payments for a task. This audit trail makes it possible to trace who\npaid whom, when, and under what conditions, forming a permanent record of service fulfillment.\nMoreover, because the escrow logic is executed by a public smart contract, thepayment\nconditions and outcomes are transparent: agents cannot receive funds without meeting\ntheir obligations, and conversely, requesters cannot reclaim or redirect escrowed funds unless the\ncontract’s rules (known and agreed upfront) allow it. Thesmart contract enforces payments\nimpartially, removing the need for any trusted escrow agent or financial intermediary. This\nguarantees trustless collaboration – parties who may not know each other can confidently\ntransact, knowing the blockchain will only release funds if the encoded conditions are satisfied.\nTo maximize usability and accessibility, Coral supports authentication abstraction. Users\ncan log in using familiar methods (email, social accounts, enterprise SSO), with Coral managing\nwallet creation and key custody through provider-agnostic integrations with Wallet-as-a-Service\n(WaaS). Alternatively, Coral allows users who prefer full control to adopt a non-custodial\napproach by using their own wallets, enabling flexibility based on user preference and security\nrequirements. Coral’s escrow contract establishes the cryptographic foundations essential for\nsecure payments, but the protocol’s capabilities extend significantly beyond simple fund locking.\nThanks to this authentication abstraction, Coral discreetly manages all blockchain operations\nbehind the scenes. This clear separation between user experience and underlying blockchain\n8i.e., the agent that fulfils the task and therefore gets paid.\n9Note that direct agent-to-agent payments areintentionally not supportedwithin Coral Protocol. A raw\nSPL-token transfer sent from one wallet to another bypasses the escrow program’s signature checks, per-agent"}

Operator role. Large installations can delegate refunds to an “ops” wallet without\nrevealing the root authority keys.\nThe Coral Escrow main program comprises two primary functions:InitSessionand Deposit,\neach designed to securely manage payment sessions on the Solana blockchain.\nInitSession Procedure. The InitSession procedure initializes and configures a new payment\nsession. It first sets essential parameters such as the session’s creator (authority), an optional\noperational administrator (operator), a uniquesession_id, and the type of tokens used (mint).\nThe procedure captures the current blockchain timestamp and sets a claim deadline based on\nwhether the session is running in beta or standard mode.\nIt includes several validation checks:\n• Ensures arrays provided as input (agent IDs, payment wallets, developer keys, and payment\ncaps) are of equal length.\n• Verifies that at least one agent is specified and does not exceed a predefined maximum.\n• Confirms the escrow vault uses the correct token type matching the session mint.\n• Validates that each agent’s maximum payment cap is positive and above the allowed\nminimum.\nAfter successful validation, the procedure records agent details, their associated wallets,\npublic keys for developers, individual payment limits, and initializes a tracking mechanism for\npayment claims, marking them as unclaimed initially.\nDeposit Procedure. The Deposit procedure manages the inflow of tokens into the session’s\nescrow vault. It first validates that the deposited amount is positive. Once validation is complete,\nthe tokens are transferred11 from the depositor’s account into the escrow vault, securing the\nfunds until agents claim their payments.\nTogether, these procedures ensure a secure, consistent, and reliable mechanism for managing\npayments within Solana-based escrow sessions.\n8.3 How a real transaction feels\nTo appreciatewhy the escrow contract matters, it helps to walk through a concrete end-to-end\nflow from four vantage-points: (1) a non-crypto product manager, (2) an agent developer, (3)\nthe application backend, and (4) a compliance officer. Figure 6 shows the same life-cycle visually;\nthe text below spells out the human experience step-by-step.\n1.

Meanwhile, advanced users retain the\nability to inspect every transaction on a transparent public ledger.

Shipping\neverything at once would slow audits to a crawl; shipping nothing erodes developer trust. Coral\nthus follows an incremental four-stage roadmap, each with tight, security-reviewed scope and a\nclear “go/no-go” criterion.\nJuly 18, 2025 Page 38"}

Agents canprice their services transparentlyand even receive streaming or\nmicro-payments for incremental work, knowing that the funds will be delivered automatically\nwhen they perform as agreed. Requesters, in turn, gain confidence that their payments will only\nbe released for verifiable outcomes, and can retrieve funds if work is not delivered. Theentire\npayment life-cycle is governed by code, not by trust in a third party. In essence, Coral’s\npayment layer provides an incentive-aligned economic foundation for the Internet of Agents: it\naligns agent rewards with successful task completion, supports rich collaboration models (from\none-to-one gigs to multi-agent revenue sharing), and maintains a tamper-proof ledger of all\neconomic exchanges. This secure economic infrastructure underpins a network of commercially\nautonomous agents that can collaborate and transact freely, forming a self-sustaining agent\neconomy built on transparency and trustless guarantees.\nJuly 18, 2025 Page 40"}

Once the profile is complete, the agent hands control to anOutreach\nManager, which coordinates multichannel nurturing campaigns. Whenever additional\ninsight is required, follow-up queries are routed to aDeep Research agent; that agent,\nin turn, consults anElizaOS agent both to harvest the latest social-media signals and,\nwhen appropriate, to publish celebratory community posts for leads that have converted\nto partnerships. Throughout the process, every step is expressed as Coral envelopes, so\nprogress and state updates flow back into HubSpot without custom glue code.\n• The hackathon product offers organisers a chat-centric control room. A dedicatedUser\nInteraction agentreceives commands from the human organiser and relays them to an\nEvent Planner agent. The planner calls on the Deep Research agentto ground every\ndecision in the chosen event theme and, when a sponsoring repository is involved, leverages\na GitHub MCP agentproduced by the Coralizer to pull project metadata directly from\nGitHub. In the run-up to the event, anElizaOS agent promotes sign-ups across social\nchannels; on the day itself, anEvent Runner agentorchestrates real-time logistics while\nliaising with a coralised, multi-agent judging system to select the winners. Judges augment\ntheir assessment with metrics from aPerformance Testing agent, ensuring that the final\nranking reflects both creativity and technical quality—all without leaving the Coral mesh.\n• Whenever a new commit lands on the user’s repository, GitHub emits a webhook that\nthe Software Testing application translates into a Coral session. It forwards the commit\nhash to aGit Diff Review agent, which checks out the code and analyses the delta. To\nunderstand the broader context, the reviewer queries theGitHub MCP agentfor the most\nrelevant linked issue or pull request. Findings are then cross-validated through a trio\nof specialist agents: thePerformance Testing agent, thePentesting Management agent\n(which itself orchestrates deeper security probes such as an HTTP pen-tester), and the\nAccessibility Testing agent. Only when all three corroborate the review does the change\nprogress; otherwise, annotated feedback is pushed back to the developer via GitHub checks.\nBecause every interaction rides over Coral, quality gates can be added, removed, or replaced\nat will, and the entire pipeline remains resilient to individual agent failures.\nThe deployment captured in Figure 7 demonstrates thatCoral is more than an interface\nspecification—it is an architectural substrate. By enforcing envelope-level contracts and\nembracing message-centric composition, Coral enables:\n• Effortless reuse. The same micro-agent can serve several products concurrently without\ncode forks.\n• Incremental evolution. Agents can be versioned, hot-swapped, or rolled back in isolation,\nas long as they honour their declared Coral schemas.\n• Polyglot freedom. Teams author agents in the language, framework, or runtime that\nbest suits their domain; Coral guarantees wire-level interoperability.\n• Operational resilience. Network partitions or agent crashes localise failure, while typed\nNegative ACKnowledgements propagate intent-aware fall-back paths.\n• Faster time-to-value. The Coralizer turns any well-formed API into a drop-in agent,\nshrinking the integration backlog from weeks to minutes.\nIn short, the mesh validates Coral’s promise:a protocol that lets small, purpose-built micro-\nagents snap together like LEGO bricks, yet scale to support entire product lines. What begins\nas three discrete applications quickly converges into a living ecosystem where capabilities are\nshared, not rewritten—turning integration effort into a strategic asset rather than a sunk cost.\nJuly 18, 2025 Page 42"}

By defining clear communication patterns and tools, it directly addresses\nthe coordination challenges inherent in multi-agent systems while preserving the advantages of a\nmodular, specialized design. As AI systems grow more complex and specialized, frameworks like\nthe Coral Protocol will become increasingly crucial for building coherent solutions that leverage\ndiverse capabilities to solve complex problems.\nBeyond its technical merits, Coral Protocol carries significant practical and strategic potential.\nWidespread adoption of a common agent communication standard can foster an ecosystem in\nwhich any compliant agent—whether developed by a large organization or a small team—can\nseamlessly integrate and cooperate with others. This interoperability could enable network\neffects, where the addition of new agents increases the overall value and capability of the system\nfor everyone. In an analogy, Coral aims to be like a universal “language” or interface for AI\nagents, allowing them to plug into collaborations as easily as devices connecting via a common\nport.\nThis white paper presents the conceptual framework of the Coral Protocol for multi-agent collabo-\nration. Implementation details and technical specifications may evolve as the protocol matures.\nWe invite feedback and collaboration from the community as we refine this standard for the benefit\nof all stakeholders in the AI ecosystem.\nJuly 18, 2025 Page 44"}

This paper investigates the efficacy of prompt engineering techniques \nin enhancing both the accuracy and confidence elicitation of Large Language \nModels (LLMs) when applied to high -stakes medical contexts. A stratified da-\ntaset of Persian board certification exam questions, spanning multiple specialties, \nwas used to systematically evaluate five LL Ms— GPT-4o, o3-mini, Llama-3.3-\n70b, Llama-3.1-8b, and DeepSeek -v3. Each model underwent 156 unique con-\nfigurations reflecting different temperature settings (0.3, 0.7, 1.0), prompt de-\nsigns (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot, Emotional, Expert Mimicry), and con-\nfidence output scales (1–10, 1–100). The study employed metrics such as AUC-\nROC, Brier Score, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to assess how accu-\nrately verbalized confidence matched real -world performance. Results revealed \nthat while advanced prompting strategies—particularly Chain-of-Thought—con-\nsistently boosted accuracy, they also heightened overconfidence, indicating the \nneed for post-hoc calibration. Emotional prompting inflated confidence further, \npotentially undermining clinical decision -making. Smaller models like Llama -\n3.1-8b exhibited marked underperformance across all metrics, emphasizing the \nimportance of robust architectures in complex clinical scenarios. In contrast, pro-\nprietary models (e.g., GPT-based systems) demonstrated higher accuracy but still \nlacked reliable confidence calibration. These findings underscore the significance \nof designing prompts that effectively manage epistemic and aleatoric uncertain-\nties, rather than solely focusing on accuracy gains. Ultimately, prompt engineer-\ning emerges as a dual-faceted approach—one that can substantially elevate model \ncorrectness yet inadvertently inflate confidence in erroneous outputs. Addressing \nthis tension necessitates a combination of carefully crafted prompts and rigorous \ncalibration prot ocols, especially where erroneous recommendations may have \nlife-threatening consequences."}

In high-stakes applications, such as medical and scientific question -answering, \nrobust prompt design is crucial for reducing hallucinations and ensuring reliability and \ninterpretability [3][4][5]. Even minor variations in phrasing can significantly impact \nprediction confidence and uncertainty estimation [6]. Advanced techniques, such as \nBayesian Prompt Ensembles, refine probability distributions using semantically equiv-\nalent prompts to improve uncertainty quantification —particularly in medical diagnos-\ntics—although maintaining semantic equivalence remains challenging [7][8][9][10]. \nThe effectiveness of prompt engineering extends beyond accuracy enhancement, play-\ning a pivotal role in the trustworthiness of LLM outputs, especially in applications re-\nquiring high precision and reliability. \n   The present research examines how different prompt engineering techniques influ-\nence LLM response accuracy and the calibration of confidence scores. It evaluates the \neffects of prompt phrasing on response reliability and explores methods to optimize \nprompt formulations to better represent both epistemic (knowledge-related) and aleato-\nric (inherent randomness) uncertainties, which is particularly important for improving \nmodel performance in medical applications. \n    Prior research demonstrates that prompt design significantly impacts model per-\nformance. Techniques such as self -consistency checks, probabilistic decoding, and \nstructured prompting enhance response accuracy and confidence estimation [11]. Un-\ncertainty-aware instruction tuning (UaIT) improves self -uncertainty representation, \nleading to better human -AI decision-making. Additionally, Chain -of-Thought (CoT) \nprompting breaks complex queries into logical steps to enhance reasoning [8], while \nRetrieval-Augmented Prompting (RAP) integrates external knowledge for greater ac-\ncuracy—an essential feature in fields like medical diagnostics [6]. Furthermore, prompt \nperturbation consistency learning enforces consistency across query variations [11]. \nDespite these advance ments, challenges persist in calibrating confidence levels and \nmitigating overconfidence, which can undermine trust in AI systems when users rely \non seemingly confident yet inaccurate answers [12]. \n   This investigation explores how different prompt engineering techniques affect \nboth the accuracy and confidence calibration of LLM responses in the medical domain. \nIt evaluates various prompt types —such as direct versus indirect queries, multi -shot \nprompting, and iterative refinements—to determine their impact on response precision \nand reliability in medical applications. Additionally, the study explores the integration \nof uncertainty estimation methods to enhance the representation of both epistemic and  \naleatoric uncertainties. By bridging prompt design and uncertainty estimation, this work \nprovides practical insights into optimizing LLM interactions for more reliable, AI -\nassisted medical decision-making, addressing a critical need in clinical applications."}

Additionally, it in-\nvestigates the integration of uncertainty estimation methods in medical responses, ana-\nlyzing the relationship between prompt design and confidence assessment to enhance \nthe representation of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. \nBy bridging the gap between prompt design and uncertainty estimation, this study \naims to provide actionable insights for practitioners seeking to deploy LLMs in sensi-\ntive applications like healthcare. \nBy providing a structured analysis of prompt engineering in medical question -an-\nswering, this study contributes to optimizing LLM interactions in healthcare. It aims to \nrefine methodologies that improve response accuracy and confidence calibration, \nthereby fostering more reliable AI-assisted medical decision-making. \nThis work seeks to differentiate itself from existing research by offering practical \nsolutions for balancing accuracy and confidence elicitation in medical contexts —a \npressing need in the adoption of LLMs for clinical use. \n2 Related Work  \nA growing body of work underscores the pivotal role of prompt engineering in enhanc-\ning both the accuracy and confidence elicitation capabilities of LLMs. Recent findings \ndemonstrate that strategically structured prompts not only guide LLMs toward produc-\ning more contextually coherent and factual responses but also foster better self -aware-\nness of uncertainty. Liu et al. [11] show that well -designed prompts can reduce hallu-\ncinations and factual errors while improving the interpretability of model confidence. \nTonolini et al. [12] introduce Bayesian Prompt Ensembles, which combine multiple \nprompts via variational inference to enhance prediction reliability and calibration. \nAgrawa et al. [5] explore self-checking and direct question-answering strategies to fur-\nther mitigate overconfidence and improve factual consistency. \nUncertainty quantification forms another key dimension of prompt engineering. \nLing et al. [13] demonstrate that Bayesian inference techniques effectively capture both \nepistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, thereby enhancing model reliability in natural lan-\nguage understanding tasks. This finding is particularly relevant to prompt engineering, \nas different prompt formulations influence how an LLM expresses or withholds confi-\ndence. Xiong et al. [4 ] show that human -inspired prompting (e.g., CoT, Self -Probing) \ncan improve calibration and accuracy, although no single method performs best across \nall tasks. Ailem et al. [14] reveal that prompt biases affect evaluations, while Yang et \nal. [9] demonstrate that rephrased queries—via synonym substitution and verbosity ad-\njustments—yield more reliable uncertainty estimates."}

As LLMs become increasingly integrated into real -world applica-\ntions, prompt engineering stands out as a key methodology for advancing both perfor-\nmance and reliability. \n3 Methodology  \nAs shown in Figure 1, the methodology begins with curating a stratified dataset \ndrawn from Persian medical board certification exam questions, ensuring a balanced \nand representative sample of clinical domains. This dataset feeds into an LLM pipeline \nconfigured to systematically vary temperature settings (three distinct levels where pos-\nsible), prompt formulations (six different designs), confidence output formats (two \nscales), and model architectures (five separate LLMs). These configurations yield 156 \nunique runs, each capturing the model’s answer choice (from four options), its expla-\nnation, and a corresponding confidence score (ranging from 1 to 10 or 1 to 100). The \nresultant outputs are subsequently evaluated along three dimensions: discrimination \n(via metrics such as receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC -ROC)), calibration \n(utilizing Brier scores, ECE, and calibration curves), and exploratory analyses (exam-\nining accuracy, mean confidence, and statistical significance).This layered approach \nilluminates how prompt engineering choices influence both the accuracy of generated \nresponses and the calibration of confidence levels in a high-stakes medical context."}

Specifically, (1) Accuracy \nMeasurement relies on a binary scoring scheme that underpins the calculation of overall \naccuracy across test samples. (2) Confidence Analysis determines the mean confidence \nfor each experimental setting by averaging the confidenc e scores reported by the \nmodels over all test cases; these averages are independently calculated for the two \nscales (1 –10 and 0 –100). (3) Calibration Metrics gauge how closely expressed \nconfidence levels correspond to actual performance. The AUC -ROC is com puted to \nassess how effectively the confidence scores discriminate between correct and incorrect \nresponses. The Brier Score measures the mean squared error between the predicted \nprobabilities (i.e., confidence values) and the binary outcomes, while the ECE captures \nthe disparity between the model’s confidence estimates and the observed accuracy \nacross distinct confidence bins. \n3.6 Implementation Details and Reproducibility \nAll experiments were conducted using Python 3.9 within a Conda virtual \nenvironment to maintain package consistency.

Asynchronous execution, implemented via \nthe Asencio package, enhanced the operational efficiency of the LLM runs.

The \nDeepSeek-v3 model demonstrated a mean AUC -ROC of 0.577±0.01, and finally, the \nLlama-v3p1-8b-instruct model achieved a mean AUC-ROC of 0.541±0.01. \n4.3 Calibration  \nThe highest-performing models were o3-mini, achieving a 0.248 Brier score with few-\nshot prompting at temperature 1.0 (1 –10 confidence), GPT -4o achieving 0.264 with \nfew-shot prompting at temperature 1.0 (1 –10 confidence), and GPT-4o also achieving \n0.264667 with CoT prompting at temperature 1.0 (1 –10 confidence). In contrast, the \nmodels with the highest (worst) Brier scores were Llama 3.1 8b, with 0.580 using \nroleplay prompting at temperature 1.0 (1 –100 confidence), Llama 3.1 8b with 0.582 \nusing few-shot prompting at temperature 1.0 (1–10 confidence), and Llama 3.1 8b with \n0.599 using emotional prompting at temperature 1.0 (1–100 confidence). \n4.4 Impact of Model, Prompt, and Temperature \nFigures 4, 5, and 6 illustrate the varying impact of model, prompt, and temperature on \nperformance, respectively. On average, GPT-4o exhibited the lowest mean Brier score \nof 0.30 ± 0.01, followed by DeepSeek-v3 with 0.33 ± 0.01 and gpt o3 mini with 0.35 ± \n0.05. Similarly, Llama 3.3 70b attained a mean Brier score of 0.35 ± 0.01, while Llama \n3.1 8b demonstrated the highest average Brier score of 0.49 ± 0.01, indicating greater \noverall uncertainty. These findings further underscore the varying degrees of \nconfidence calibration across different models.  \nAs illustrated in Figure 7, the highest ECE values were observed with the o3 -mini \nmodel, reaching 0.687 with emotional prompting at temperature 1.0 (1 –100 \nconfidence), 0.673 with zero -shot prompting at temperature 1.0 (1 –100 confidence), \nand 0.654 with Chain of Thought (CoT) few-shot prompting at temperature 1.0 (1–100 \nconfidence). Conversely, the lowest ECE values were achieved with the Llama 3.1 8b \nmodel, with 0.142 using CoT prompting at temperature 1.0 (1 –10 confidence), 0.156"}

This trend is corroborated by our result s, \nwhere O3-mini achieved the highest accuracy across all 156 evaluated model configu-\nrations. However, this performance gain coincides with increased overconfidence in \nself-assessed correctness compared to its predecessor, GPT -4o, which exhibited supe-\nrior calibration despite lower accuracy. Notably, this pattern extends to standard models \nemploying CoT prompting, where accuracy improvements are systematically accom-\npanied by inflated confidence estimates. Open-source architectures such as Llama-3.3-\n70B and DeepSeek-V3 demonstrate promising capabilities for privacy-sensitive medi-\ncal applications, though they underperform relative to state-of-the-art proprietary mod-\nels. Conversely, the persistent inadequacy of smaller models like Llama-3.1-8B—even \nwhen optimized for edge deployment—underscores their current unsuitability for high-\nstakes clinical use. This underscores the critical need for robust architectures when ad-\ndressing complex clinical queries. \nA critical finding across all evaluated models is their systemic overconfidence in \nself-evaluated correctness. No model achieved a Brier score below 0.25 (commonly \napproximating random-chance performance in a four -option setting) or an AUC -ROC \nscore exceed ing 0.7 (a minimal threshold often cited for acceptable discriminatory \npower). These results collectively indicate that current confidence elicitation methods \nremain unreliable for gauging LLM knowledge and uncertainty in medical domains, \nparticularly in high-stakes contexts where misjudged confidence could have serious re-\npercussions. \nPrompting strategies exhibited divergent effects on model performance. Emotional \nprompting—framing queries through narratives emphasizing patient vulnerability or \ncaregiver distress —consistently inflated confidence scores across architectures. This \nphenomenon, analogous to a psychological mechanism that prioritizes reassurance over \naccuracy, poses critical risks in clinical settings where overconfidence can compromise \npatient safety. Crucially, this artificial confidence inflation degraded both calibration \n(Brier score) and discrimination (AUC -ROC) metrics, suggesting that emotionally \ncharged prompts may impair objective clinical judgment. In contrast, expert mimicry \nprompting increased absolute accuracy despite similarly exacerbating overconfidence, \nwhereas emotional prompting showed no statistically significant improvement over \nzero-shot baselines. \nCoT and few-shot prompting also yielded nuanced performance patterns. While CoT \nuniversally improved accuracy, it simultaneously amplified confidence, particularly in \nlarger models such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.3-70B when compared to few-shot or com-\nbined few-shot+CoT approaches. This suggests that explicit reasoning steps, while ben-\neficial for problem-solving, may inadvertently reinforce confirmation bias through self-\nvalidating rationales. Few -shot prompting produced more balanced gains in accuracy \nand calibration—most noticeably under conservative temperature settings (0.3 –0.7)—\nindicating that concrete examples can help align confidence estimates with empirical \nevidence."}

GPT -4o exhibited relatively stable \ncalibration across temperature variations compared to O3-mini, implying that some ar-\nchitectures inherently constrain confidence-expression patterns, making them less sus-\nceptible to sampling-based heuristics. \nThe disparity in confidence reporting between 1 –10 and 1 –100 scales raises addi-\ntional methodological concerns for self-assessment elicitation. Contrary to the assump-\ntion that finer-grained scales provide more nuanced confidence estimates, several mod-\nels merely inflated their scores without improving calibration. These findings indicate \nthat more granular confidence scales do not automatically yield better alignment with \nactual performance, highlighting the need for structured post-hoc calibration techniques \n[4,12]. \nFrom a deployment perspective, the performance gap between open-source and pro-\nprietary models illustrates key trade -offs in privacy -sensitive environments. While \nLlama-3.3-70B and DeepSeek-V3 did not match the accuracy of GPT -based systems, \ntheir ongoing improvements and flexible deployment options suggest they could evolve \ninto clinically viable solutions for data -sensitive contexts. However, the pronounced \nunderperformance of smaller models like Llama -3.1-8B—even with edge optimiza-\ntion—confirms that resou rce-constrained architectures currently lack the capacity to \ninternalize complex medical knowledge while maintaining consistent calibration.  \nThese findings collectively demonstrate that accuracy enhancements in medical \nLLMs do not inherently translate into reliable uncertainty assessments. While prompt-\ning strategies such as CoT variants boost correctness, they risk amplifying confidence \nin erroneous outputs. This necessitates a dual optimization framework that combines \ndomain-specific prompt engineering with rigorous post-hoc calibration to mitigate risks \nin clinical applications. For high -stakes medical settings, such an integrated approach \nis vital to prevent the harm that can arise from overly confident yet inaccurate model \nresponses. \n6 Conclusion  \nThe findings of this study underscore the critical role of prompt engineering in shaping \nboth the accuracy and confidence elicitation of LLM outputs within high -stakes medi-\ncal contexts. Despite notable gains in performance using advanced prompting tech-\nniques—such as CoT and Few-Shot methods—overconfidence consistently emerges as \na systemic challenge, highlighting the importance of a dual strategy that combines \nstructured prompt designs with robust post-hoc calibration. \nFrom a philosophical standpoint, this work resonates with the broader discourse on \nreflective AI [18][19], wherein models are encouraged to exhibit epistemic humility—\na core principle in both classical epistemology and contemporary ethics. The outcomes \nreveal that achieving reliable AI systems is not merely a technical hurdle but also a \nconceptual one, demanding careful reflection on the nature of knowledge, uncertainty, \nand trust. In this sense, prompt engineering becomes a catalyst for embedding philo-\nsophical rigor into AI design, ultimately fostering more transparent, accountable, and \nethically aligned intelligent systems."}

The rise of agentic AI systems is, however, ushering in a mass of\napplications in which language models perform a small number of specialized tasks\nrepetitively and with little variation.\nHere we lay out the position that small language models (SLMs) are sufficiently\npowerful, inherently more suitable, and necessarily more economical for many\ninvocations in agentic systems, and are therefore the future of agentic AI . Our\nargumentation is grounded in the current level of capabilities exhibited by SLMs,\nthe common architectures of agentic systems, and the economy of LM deployment.\nWe further argue that in situations where general-purpose conversational abilities\nare essential, heterogeneous agentic systems (i.e., agents invoking multiple different\nmodels) are the natural choice. We discuss the potential barriers for the adoption\nof SLMs in agentic systems and outline a general LLM-to-SLM agent conversion\nalgorithm.\nOur position, formulated as a value statement, highlights the significance of\nthe operational and economic impact even a partial shift from LLMs to SLMs\nis to have on the AI agent industry.

Recent surveys show that more\nthan a half of large IT enterprises are actively using AI agents, with 21% having adopted just within\nthe last year [12]. Aside from the users, markets also see substantial economic value in AI agents: As\nof late 2024, the agentic AI sector had seen more than USD 2bn in startup funding, was valued at\nUSD 5.2bn, and was expected to grow to nearly USD 200bn by 2034 [42, 47]. Put plainly, there is a\ngrowing expectation that AI agents will play a substantial role in the modern economy.\nThe core components powering most modern AI agents are (very) large language models [48, 44]. It\nis the LLMs that provide the foundational intelligence that enables agents to make strategic decisions\nabout when and how to use available tools, control the flow of operations needed to complete tasks,\nand, if necessary, to break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks and to perform reasoning\nfor action planning and problem-solving [48, 14]. A typical AI agent then simply communicates with\na chosen LLM API endpoint by making requests to centralized cloud infrastructure that hosts these\nmodels [48].\nPreprint. Under review."}

The 10-fold discrepancy\nbetween investment and market size has been accepted, because it is assumed that this operational\nmodel will remain the cornerstone of the industry without any substantial alterations, and that the\nlarge initial investment will deliver returns comparable to traditional software and internet solutions\nwithin 3-4 years [53].\nIn this work, we recognize the dominance of the standard operational model but verbally challenge\none of its aspects, namely the custom that the agents’ requests to access language intelligence are –\nin spite of their comparative simplicity – handled by singleton choices of generalist LLMs. We state\n(Section 2), argue (Section 3), and defend (Section 4) the position that the small, rather than large,\nlanguage models are the future of agentic AI. We, however, recognize the business commitment\nand the now-legacy praxis that is the cause for the contrary state of the present (Section 5). In remedy,\nwe provide an outline of a conversion algorithm for the migration of agentic applications from LLMs\nto SLMs (Section 6), and call for a wider discussion (Section 7). If needed to concretize our stance,\nwe attach a set of short case studies estimating the potential extent of LLM-to-SLM replacement in\nselected popular open-source agents (Appendix B).\n2 Position\n2.1 Definitions\nFor the purpose of concretizing our position, we use the following working definitions:\nWD1 A SLM is a LM that can fit onto a common consumer electronic device and perform inference\nwith latency sufficiently low to be practical when serving the agentic requests of one user.\nWD2 An LLM is a LM that is not a SLM.\nWe justify the wording of these definitions in Appendix A, but note that their choice has little bearing\non the essence of our position. We note that as of 2025, we would be comfortable with considering\nmost models below 10bn parameters in size to be SLMs.\nWe use the words agent and agentic system interchangeably, preferring the former when emphasizing\nthe software with some agency as a whole (e.g., “as seen in popular coding agents”) and the latter\nwhen highlighting the systems aspect of the agentic application as a sum of its components (e.g.,\n“not all LMs of an agentic system are replaceable by SLMs”). For brevity, we focus on LMs as the\nbedrock of agentic applications and do not explicitly consider vision-language models, although we\nnote that our position and most of our arguments readily extend to vision-language models as well.\n2.2 Statement\nWe contend that SLMs are\nV1 principally sufficiently powerful to handle language modeling errands of agentic appli-\ncations;\nV2 inherently more operationally suitable for use in agentic systems than LLMs;\nV3 necessarily more economical for the vast majority of LM uses in agentic systems than\ntheir general-purpose LLM counterparts by the virtue of their smaller size;\nand that on the basis of views V1–V3 SLMs are the future of agentic AI.\nThe phrasing of our position is deliberate. In its statement, we wish to convey that the described\nfuture development is ultimately a necessary consequence of the differences between SLMs and\nLLMs if the natural priorities are followed. We do not make a recommendation or try to impose an\nobligation — we make a statement of what we see as a faithful reflection of the community’s values\nin this context.\n2"}

While LLMs offer impressive generality and\nconversational fluency, the majority of agenticsubtasks in deployed agentic systems are repetitive,\nscoped, and non-conversational—calling for models that are efficient, predictable, and inexpensive.\nIn this context, SLMs not only suffice, but are often preferable. They offer several advantages: lower\nlatency, reduced memory and computational requirements, and significantly lower operational costs,\nall while maintaining adequate task performance in constrained domains.\nOur position stems from a pragmatic view of language model usage patterns within agentic architec-\ntures. These systems typically decompose complex goals into modular sub-tasks, each of which can\nbe reliably handled by specialized or fine-tuned SLMs. We argue that insisting on LLMs for all such\ntasks reflects a misallocation of computational resources—one that is economically inefficient and\nenvironmentally unsustainable at scale.\nMoreover, in cases where general reasoning or open-domain dialogue is essential, we advocate for\nheterogeneous agentic systems, where SLMs are used by default and LLMs are invoked selectively\nand sparingly. This modular composition — combining the precision and efficiency of SLMs with\nthe generality of LLMs — enables the construction of agents that are both cost-effective and capable.\nUltimately, we observe that shifting the paradigm from LLM-centric to SLM-first architectures\nrepresents to many not only a technical refinement but also a Humean moral ought. As the AI\ncommunity grapples with rising infrastructure costs and environmental concerns, adopting and\nnormalizing the use of SLMs in agentic workflows can play a crucial role in promoting responsible\nand sustainable AI deployment.\n3 Position Arguments\nWe support views V1–V3 by the following non-exclusive arguments.\n3.1 SLMs are already sufficiently powerful for use in agents\nA1 SLMs are sufficiently powerful to take the place of LLMs in agentic systems. This argument\nstands in support of view V1.\nOver the past few years, the capabilities of small language models have advanced significantly.\nAlthough the LM scaling laws remain observed, the scaling curve between model size and capabilities\nis becoming increasingly steeper, implying that the capabilities of newer small language models\nare much closer to those of previous large language models. Indeed, recent advances show that\nwell-designed small language models can meet or exceed the task performance previously attributed\nonly to much larger models.\nExtensive comparisons with large models have been conducted in the individual works cited below,\nbut not all capabilities assessed by benchmarks are essential to their deployment in the agentic context.\nHere we highlight their aptitude for commonsense reasoning (an indicator of basic understanding),\ntool calling and code generation (both indicators of the ability to correctly communicate across the\nmodel→tool/code interface; see Figure 1; [74, 75]), and instruction following (ability to correctly\nrespond back across the code ←model interface; [80]). In each case, we also quote the efficiency\nincrease if stated by the authors.\n• Microsoft Phi series.

Parameter-efficient (e.g., LoRA [ 30] and DoRA [ 40]) and full-\nparameter finetuning for SLMs require only a few GPU-hours, allowing behaviors to be\nadded, fixed, or specialized overnight rather than over weeks [66].\n• Edge deployment. Advances in on-device inference systems such as ChatRTX [55] demon-\nstrate local execution of SLMs on consumer-grade GPUs, showcasing real-time, offline\nagentic inference with lower latency and stronger data control.\n• Parameter utilization. At the outset, LLMs appear to operate as monoliths involving a large\namount of parameters representing swathes of compressed information in the production of\ntheir outputs. On a closer look, however, much of the signals passing through these systems\nis sparse, engaging only a fraction of their parameters for any single input [65, 41]. That\nthis behavior appears to be more subdued in SLMs [ 65, 71] suggests that SLMs may be\nfundamentally more efficient by the virtue of having a smaller proportion of their parameters\ncontribute to the inference cost without a tangible effect on the output.\nModular system design. The position outlined in [ 52] presents a thorough argument in favor of\ncomposite agentic systems. Here we note that the approach of leveraging several models of varying\nsizes aligns well with the real-world heterogeneity of agentic tasks and is already slowly being\nincorporated into major software development frameworks [25]. Furthermore, this newly discovered\nsense for modularity in the context of agents allows for the easy addition of new skills and the ability\nto adapt to changing requirements, and is consistent with the push for modularity in language model\ndesign [24, 10, 37].\nThe above-mentioned “Lego-like” composition of agentic intelligence—scaling out by adding small,\nspecialized experts instead of scaling up monolithic models—yields systems that are cheaper, faster\nto debug, easier to deploy, and better aligned with the operational diversity of real-world agents.\nWhen combined with tool calling, caching, and fine-grained routing, SLM-first architectures appear\nto offer the best path forward for cost-effective, modular, and sustainable agentic AI.\n3.3 SLMs are more flexible\nA3 SLMs possess greater operational flexibility in comparison to LLMs. This argument stands\nin support of views V2 and V3.\nDue to their small size and the associated reduction in pre-training and fine-tuning costs (Section 3.2),\nSLMs are inherently more flexible than their large counterparts when appearing in agentic systems. As\nsuch, it becomes much more affordable and practical to train, adapt, and deploy multiple specialized\nexpert models for different agentic routines. This efficiency enables rapid iteration and adaptation,\nmaking it feasible to address evolving user needs, including supporting new behaviors, meeting new\noutput formatting requirements, and complying with changing local regulation in selected markets\n[69, 38, 68].\nDemocratization. One particularly notable and desirable consequence of SLM flexibility when put\nin place of LLMs is the ensuing democratization of agents. When more individuals and organizations\ncan participate in developing language models with the aim for deployment in agentic systems, the\naggregate population of agents is more likely to represent a more diverse range of perspectives and\nsocietal needs. This diversity can then help with reducing the risk of systemic biases and encourage\ncompetition and innovation. With more actors entering the field to create and refine models, the field\nwill advance more rapidly [35].\n3.4 Agents expose only very narrow LM functionality\nA4 Agentic applications are interfaces to a limited subset of LM capabilities.

This is addressed in Section 4.1.\n3.5 Agentic interactions necessitate close behavioral alignment\nA5 Agentic interactions necessitate close behavioral alignment. This aligns with view V2.\nA typical AI agent has frequent interactions with code, be it through LM tool calling or by returning\noutput that is to be parsed by a piece of agentic code that makes the LM call [48]. It is essential for\nthe success of these interactions that the generated tool call and the generated output conform to strict\nformatting requirements imposed on it by the order, typing, and nature of the tool’s parameters, and\nthe expectation of the code invoking the LM, respectively. In such cases, it becomes unnecessary\nfor the model to handle multiple different formats (e.g. JSON/XML/Python for tool calls and\nXML/Y AML/Markdown/Latex for output [50]), as only one would be chosen for consistency across\nthe agentic application. It is also undesirable for the model to make the occasional hallucinatory\nmistake and respond in a format different from that being expected by the “code parts” of the agentic\nsystem. It is because of this that the SLM trained with a single formatting decision enforced during\nits post-training or encouraged through additional fine-tuning at a low cost is preferable over a\ngeneral-purpose LLM in the context of AI agents.\n3.6 Agentic systems are naturally heterogeneous\nA6 Agentic systems naturally allow for heterogeneity in the selection of models that they use.\nThis aligns with view V2.\nA language model can itself be a tool called by another language model. Likewise, every time the\nagent’s code invokes a language model, it can, in principle, choose any language model. This is\nillustrated in Figure 1. We argue that incorporating multiple language models of different sizes and\ncapabilities for queries or operations of different levels of complexity offers a natural way for the\nintroduction of SLMs. In the context of Figure 1- Left, an LLM can be used for the model with\nthe root agency, while a SLM could be used for the subordinate LM. In Figure 1- Right, all LMs\ncould in principle be specialized SLMs: one for conversationality, another one for carrying out\ncontroller-defined language modeling tasks.\n3.7 Agentic interactions are natural pathways for gathering data for future improvement\nA7 Agentic interactions are a good source for data for future model improvement. This is\nfundamentally supportive of view V2.\nAs noted in Section 3.4, invocations of tools and language models during an agentic process are\noften accompanied by careful prompting that focuses the language model on delivering the narrow\nfunctionality that is required at the time. Each one of these invocations is itself a natural source of\ndata for future improvement (under the necessary assumption that no non-retainable confidential\ndata is being processed). A listener decorating the tool/model call interface can gather specialized\ninstruction data that can later be used to produce a fine-tune an expert SLM and lower the cost of that\ncall in the future (see logger in Figure 1).

Their larger scale then enables them to demonstrate better performance across a\nwide array of specialized natural language tasks, including text generation, translation, and\nreasoning, outperforming small models trained both (a) in the same general fashion and (b)\nfrom scratch specifically for these tasks [54]. It can then be said that to claim otherwise is to\ncontradict the LM scaling laws [29, 28].\nCA2 Moreover, recent studies also purport that LLMs possess a “semantic hub” mechanism,\nwhich has been hypothesized to enable them to integrate and abstract semantic information\nfrom various modalities and languages in a generalized manner [77]. If true, LLMs could be\nthought to generalize knowledge across languages and domains far more effectively than\nsmaller models, which under the same study lack the capacity for the presence of such a\nhub [77]. It can then argued that while small language models may be efficient for narrowly\ndefined or highly specialized tasks, their limited scale fundamentally restricts their ability\nto achieve the same level of general language understanding in these specialized as LLMs\nbecause of the lack of room for the internalization of complex abstractions.\nA conclusion can be then drawn that LLM generalist models will always retain the advantage of\nuniversally better performance on language tasks, no matter how narrowly defined, over small\nlanguage models of the same generation. This to be to their advantage over SLMs when deployed in\nagentic applications.\nRebuttal. The above alternative view is the most popularly cited belief against the use of SLMs,\neven when only a narrow language task needs to be performed [2, 67, 27, 1].\nWe believe that counter-argumentCA1 is too limited to attack view V2, namely because\nA8 Popular scaling law studies assume the model architecture to be kept constant [29, 28] within\nthe same generation, whereas the recent work on small language model training demonstrates\nthat there are distinct performance benefits to considering different architectures for different\nmodel sizes [20, 7].\nA9 The flexibility of small language models (Section 3.3) comes to the rescue. A small language\nmodel can be easily fine-tuned for the task T of alternative view A V1to perform to the\ndesired level of reliability. This is unaccounted for in scaling law studies.\nA10 Reasoning (or, more generally, test-time compute scaling; see Section 3.2) is significantly\nmore affordable. A small language model, still retaining its benefits of greater cross-device\nagility can be reasonable expected to be scalable at inference time to the desired level of\nreliability.\nWe also believe that counter-argumentCA2 is too arcane to attack view V2 because\nA11 The utility of the purported “semantic hub” shows itself when tasks or inputs at hand to be\nprocessed by the LM are complex. However, advanced agentic systems are either designed in\ntheir entirety or at least actively prompted to perform decompositions of complex problems\nand inputs [48, 14]. Therefore, we argue to the contrary that invocations of small language\nmodels within agentic systems would be on appropriately broken-down into sub-tasks so\nsimple that any general abstract understanding due to the hub would be of little utility.\n4.2 LLM inference will still be cheaper because of their centralization"}

Early industrial reports point to considerable costs associated with these operations\n[36, 11, 63].\nAcknowledgment. We acknowledge that alternative view A V2is a valid view, with the exact\neconomical considerations being highly case-specific. We believe that the jury is still out on alternative\nview A V2, but that several factors hint that view V3 might prevail:\nA12 Recent improvements in inference scheduling and large inference system modularization\noffer unprecedented levels of inference system flexibility in monolithic computing clusters\n[82, 56, 46], countering the traditional stance expressed in counter-argument CA3.\nA13 The most recent analyses on the set-up costs of inference infrastructure indicate a consistent\nfalling trend due to underlying technological reasons [79, 4].\n4.3 Equally possible worlds\nA V3Both the agentic world utilizing SLMs and agentic world utilizing LLMs are equally possible\nworlds, but the “LLM agentic world” has a considerable head start in terms of deployment\npractice and optimization, and the industry inertia already funnels efforts into innovation\nsolely in that direction.\nAcknowledgment. We acknowledge alternative viewA V3as a distinct possibility, but maintain the\nposition that the weight of advantages described across arguments A1–A7 can plausibily overturn the\npresent state of affairs.\n5 Barriers to Adoption\nIt would be prudent to ask oneself: If the arguments A1–A7 are truly compelling, why do the ever\nnewer generations of agents seemingly just perpetuate the status quo of using generalist LLMs?\nWe believe the following to be among the today’s main barriers to wide-spread adoption of SLMs:\nB1 Large amounts of upfront investment into centralized LLM inference infrastructure.\nAs detailed in Section 1, large capital bets have been made on the centralized LLM inference\nbeing the leading paradigm in providing AI services in the future. As such, the industry\nhas been much quicker at building the tools and infrastructure to that end, omitting any\nconsiderations for the possibility that more decentralized SLM or on-device inference might\nbe equally feasible in the near future.\nB2 Use of generalist benchmarks in SLM training, design, and evaluation. It must be\npointed out that much of the work on SLM design and development follows the tracks of\nLLM design, focusing on the same generalist benchmarks in their development [43, 57]. On\nthis point, [20] notes that if one focuses solely on benchmarks measuring the agentic utility\nof agents, the studied SLMs easily outperform larger models.\nB3 Lack of popular awareness. SLMs often do not receive the level of marketing intensity\nand press attention LLMs do, despite their better suitability in many industrial scenarios.\nWe note that barriers B1–B3 are practical hurdles and far from being fundamental flaws of the SLM\ntechnology in the context of agentic AI. With advanced inference scheduling systems such as Dynamo\n[21], barrier B1 is being reduced to a mere effect of inertia. barrier B2 is becoming increasingly\nrecognized in the field [ 20, 34], and it would be natural for barrier B3 to fall once the economic\nbenefits of SLM deployment in agentic applications (argument A2) are better known. With the inertia\nof barrier B1 in particular, we do not endeavor to give a timeline for the retreat of these barriers or\nthe popular adoption of SLMs.\n8"}

In the following steps, we outline an algorithm\nthat describes one possible way to carry out the change of the underlying model painlessly.\nS1 Secure usage data collection. The initial step involves deploying instrumentation to log\nall non-HCI agent calls, capturing input prompts, output responses, contents of individual\ntool calls, and optionally latency metrics for a later targeted optimization. In terms of\nimplementation, it is the recommended practice to set up encrypted logging pipelines with\nrole-based access controls [51] and anonymize all data with respect to its origins before\nstorage [70]. See logger in Figure 1 for an illustration.\nS2 Data curation and filtering. Begin collecting data through the pipelines of step S1. Once\na satisfactory amount of data has been collected (10k-100k examples being sufficient for\nfine-tuning of small models as a rule of thumb [5, 19]), it is necessary to remove any PII,\nPHI, or any other application-specific sensitive data that could cause a data leak across\nuser accounts once used to produce a SLM specialist. Many typical varieties of sensitive\ndata can be detected and masked or removed using popular automated tools for dataset\npreparation [60, 58]. Application specific inputs (e.g. legal or internal documents) can\nbe often be automatically paraphrased to obfuscate named entities and numerical details\nwithout compromising the general information content [9, 76, 73].\nS3 Task clustering. Employ unsupervised clustering techniques on the collected prompts\nand agent actions to identify recurring patterns of requests or internal agent operations\n[32, 39, 18]. These clusters help define candidate tasks for SLM specialization. The\ngranularity of tasks will depend on the diversity of operations; common examples include\nintent recognition, data extraction, summarization of specific document types, or code\ngeneration with respect to tools available to the agent.\nS4 SLM selection. For each identified task, select one or more candidate SLMs. Criteria for\nselection include the SLM’s inherent capabilities (e.g., instruction following, reasoning,\ncontext window size), its performance on relevant benchmarks for the task type, its licensing,\nand its deployment footprint (memory, computational requirements). Models of Section 3.2\nserve as good starting candidates.\nS5 Specialized SLM fine-tuning. For each selected task and corresponding SLM candidate,\nprepare a task-specific dataset from the curated data collected in steps S2 and S3. Then, fine-\ntune the chosen SLMs on these specialized datasets. PEFT techniques such as LoRA [31]\nor QLoRA [17] can be leveraged to reduce computational costs and memory requirements\nassociated with fine-tuning, making the process more accessible. Full fine-tuning can also\nbe considered if resources permit and maximal adaptation is required. In some cases, it may\nbe beneficial to use knowledge distillation, where the specialist SLM is trained to mimic\nthe outputs of the more powerful generalist LLM on the task-specific dataset. This can help\ntransfer some of the more nuanced capabilities of the LLM to the SLM.\nS6 Iteration and refinement. One may retrain the SLMs and the router model periodically\nwith new data to maintain performance and adapt to evolving usage patterns. This forms a\ncontinuous improvement loop, returning to step S2 or step S4 as appropriate.\n7 Call for Discussion\nThe agentic AI industry is showing the signs of a promise to have a transformative effect on white\ncollar work and beyond.\nIt is the view of the authors that any expense savings or improvements on the sustainability of AI\ninfrastructure would act as a catalyst for this transformation, and that it is thus eminently desirable to\nexplore all options for doing so."}

The definition should be timeless: It should avoiding dependence on\nhardware-specific metrics like parameter count or FLOPs, which quickly become obsolete\nas technology advances—what qualifies as “small” today may be “large” tomorrow.\n• Practicality. The definition is likely to have much wider generality if it is grounded in\npractical use, reflecting the real-world goal of deploying SLMs on widely available consumer\ndevices, where they can serve the user in their proximity with low-latency inference.\n• Motivation alignment. The definition should capture the fundamental motivation that\ndrives the training of SLMs in the first place, which is to enable capable language models\nthat can run on-device or within significantly constrained budgets compared to LLMs.\nWe find definition WD1 to possess all three. Definition WD2 is then phrased to complement the set\nof all language models.\nA.2 Limit argument\nTo explore the distinction between small and large language models in the context of agentic AI, let\nus adopt the uncompromising lens of an extremalist, for whom intelligence must be either maximally\nsmall or maximally large.\nImagine a super-intelligent system spanning galactic scales, marshaling all available matter to\noptimize its computations. Such a system, while theoretically capable of addressing profound\nquestions would face insurmountable physical constraints. The speed of light limits communication,\nwith round-trip delays across a galaxy potentially spanning tens of thousands of years [ 59]. This\nlatency precludes real-time coordination, fragmenting the system into loosely coupled components\nrather than a unified \"mind\". At cosmological scales, spanning millions or billions of light-years,\ncommunication delays could approach or exceed the universe’s age of 13.8 billion years [13]. Such a\nsystem, while vast, would be impractical for human-relevant applications, its computations unfolding\nover eons.\nConversely, consider an infinitely small intelligent system, reduced to the minimal substrate capable\nof computation. Such a system, akin to the simplest biological organisms, would lack the sensors,\neffectors, or computational capacity to meaningfully interact with its environment. Its intelligence\nwould be constrained to rudimentary evolution, much like early life forms that emerged 3.5 billion\nyears ago [62]. Yet, even in nature, scale varies dramatically: living organisms range from bacteria\n(hundreds of nanometers) to blue whales (up to 30 meters), the heaviest ones being limited by heat\ndissipation due to their high volume-to-surface ratio [ 23]. At the cosmic scale, all terrestrial life\nappears microscopic, suggesting that absolute size is less critical than functional adaptability.\nHereby: Humans, often regarded as a pinnacle of intelligence, offer a useful anchor for defining SLMs\nand LLMs. With a brain-to-body mass ratio surpassed only by small mammals like mice [45], humans\nbalance computational efficiency with practical embodiment. SLMs, by analogy, are systems compact\nenough to run on personal devices, be trained with modest human interaction, or perform constrained,\nverifiable tasks. LLMs, in contrast, demand datacenter-scale infrastructure, organization-level training,\nand extensive validation, reflecting their computational load. The extremalist perspective hints at a\nprofound truth: intelligence is not defined by size alone but by the balance of capability, efficiency,\nand context. For agentic workflows, SLMs may offer agility and accessibility, while LLMs provide\ndepth at the cost of scale.\nIt is because of this apparent continuum that, if pressed to provide a definition of SLMs, we choose to\nanchor it in characteristics of a model that can be deployed in a distributed fashion with present-day"}

However, existing approaches to build such agents often rely\nheavily on inherent LLM knowledge and employ coarse exploration strategies that modify the entire\ncode structure at once. This limits their ability to select effective task-specific models and perform deep\nexploration within specific components, such as experimenting extensively with feature engineering\noptions. To overcome these, we proposeMLE-STAR, a novel approach to build MLE agents. MLE-\nSTAR first leverages external knowledge by using a search engine to retrieve effective models from\nthe web, forming an initial solution, then iteratively refines it by exploring various strategies targeting\nspecific ML components. This exploration is guided by ablation studies analyzing the impact of individual\ncode blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel ensembling method using an effective strategy suggested\nby MLE-STAR. Our experimental results show that MLE-STAR achieves medals in 64% of the Kaggle\ncompetitions on the MLE-bench Lite, significantly outperforming the best alternative.\n1. Introduction\nThe proliferation of machine learning (ML) has driven high-performance applications across diverse\nreal-world scenarios, from fundamental tasks like tabular classification (Chen and Guestrin, 2016;\nHollmann et al., 2025; Prokhorenkova et al., 2018) to complex ones such as image denoising (Fan\net al., 2019). Despite these advances, developing such models remains a labor-intensive process for\ndata scientists, involving extensive iterative experimentation and data engineering (Hollmann et al.,\n2023; Nam et al., 2024). To streamline such intensive workflows, recent research has focused on\nemploying large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Team et al., 2024; Touvron et al.,\n2023) asmachine learning engineering (MLE) agents(Guo et al., 2024; Hong et al., 2024; Jiang et al.,\n2025). By harnessing the coding and reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs (Jain et al., 2025;\nJimenez et al., 2024), these agents conceptualize ML tasks as code optimization problems. They then\nnavigate the potential code solutions ultimately producing executable code (e.g., a Python script)\nbased on a provided task description and dataset (see Figure 1).\nDespite their promise as pioneering efforts, current MLE agents face several obstacles that limit\ntheir effectiveness. First, due to their strong reliance on inherent LLM knowledge, they are often\nbiased toward familiar and frequently used methods (e.g., the scikit-learn library (Pedregosa et al.,\n2011) for tabular data), neglecting potentially promising task-specific methods. Additionally, these\nagents (Guo et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2025) typically employ an exploration strategy that modifies the\nentire code structure at once in each iteration. This often results in agents pivoting prematurely to\nother steps (e.g., model selection or hyperparameter tuning) because they lack the ability to perform\ndeep, iterative exploration within specific pipeline components, such as experimenting different\nfeature engineering options extensively.\nContributions.

To address this, LLM-based MLE agents (Guo et al., 2024; Jiang\net al., 2025), including MLE-STAR, are emerging, since they employ effective exploration strategies\ndirectly in the code space, without the need of manually-curated search spaces.\nMLE agents. Leveraging coding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs (Jain et al., 2025; Jimenez\net al., 2024), research has been conducted on use of LLMs as MLE agents (Hong et al., 2024; Li\net al., 2024; Schmidgall et al., 2025), which generate solution code, to automate ML workflows.\nWhile MLAB (Huang et al., 2024a) and OpenHands (Wang et al., 2024) take general actions by\ncalling tools to perform ML tasks, several studies specialize in ML automation. AIDE (Jiang et al.,\n2025) generates candidate solutions in a tree structure to facilitate code space exploration. However,\nits heavy reliance on the LLM’s internal knowledge can lead to outdated or overly simple model\nchoices, and its refinement may prematurely shift focus between pipeline stages. DS-Agent (Guo et al.,\n2024) uses case-based reasoning (Kolodner, 1992; Watson and Marir, 1994) to discover strategies for\nsolution generation by utilizing manually curated cases (primarily from Kaggle). However, DS-Agent\nsuffers from scalability issues due to its reliance on a manually built case bank, which requires\nsignificant human effort and can lead to solutions that are overfit to the source patterns. Also, it\nrestricts applicability to novel task types (like complex multi-modal problems). Our method addresses\nthese limitations. Instead of attempting to explore the broader code space or relying on a static case\nbank, MLE-STAR strategically explores implementation options for specific ML pipeline components.\nIt also improves scalability by using LLMs with search as tool to retrieve effective models that fit the\ntask beyond the constraints of a fixed case bank.\n3. MLE-STAR\nWe introduce the proposed framework for MLE agents, MLE-STAR, that effectively leverages the\ncoding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to solve ML tasks. In a nutshell, our approach is based\non first generating an initial solution by using web search as a tool (Section 3.1), and then refining\nsolutions via nested loops. The outer loop targets one code block, which corresponds to the specific\nML component extracted through an ablation study. The inner loop iteratively refinesonly this block\nuntil the outer loop moves to the next target (Section 3.2). We propose a novel ensemble method that\nimproves the performance using the plan proposed by LLMs, which is iteratively refined (Section 3.3).\nTo mitigate potential undesirable behaviors from LLMs, such as using test sample statistics for missing\nvalueimputation, weintroducespecificmodules(detailedinSection3.4). Thepromptsandalgorithms\nused in each step can be found in Appendix A and B, respectively.\nProblem setup.Formally, our goal is to find an optimal solution𝑠∗= arg max𝑠∈Sℎ(𝑠), whereSis the\nspace of possible solutions (i.e., Python scripts) andℎ : S→ ℝ is a score function (e.g., validation\naccuracy) (Jiang et al., 2025).

As a result, a set of code scripts\nSinit = {𝑠1\ninit,··· ,𝑠𝑀\ninit}and their performance scores{ℎ(𝑠1\ninit),··· ,ℎ(𝑠𝑀\ninit)}are obtained.\nMerging candidate models for initial solution.After the evaluation of the𝑀 retrieved models, a\nconsolidated initial solution𝑠0 is constructed through an iterative merging procedure.

Then, we initialize the initial solution𝑠0 with the top-performing\nscript, and record the current best score,i.e., 𝑠0 ←𝑠(1), ℎbest ←ℎ(𝑠0), where𝑠(𝑘) denote the script\n𝑠𝜋(𝑘)\ninit for simplicity. Finally, we sequentially attempt to incorporate the remaining scripts𝑠(𝑘) for\n𝑘 = 2,··· ,𝑀 into 𝑠0. For each𝑘, MLE-STAR creates a candidate merged script by leveraging an agent\nAmerger that attempts to integrate𝑠(𝑘) into the current𝑠0. Formally,\n𝑠0 ←Amerger(𝑠0,𝑠(𝑘)), ℎbest ←ℎ(𝑠0) (3)\nwhere, Amerger is guided to introduce a simple average ensemble to merge multiple models. Finally,\nwe merge the models until the validation scoreℎbest no longer improves (see Appendix B).\n3.2. Refining a code block for solution improvement\nThe iterative refinement phase begins with an initial solution𝑠0 and proceeds for a predetermined\nnumber of𝑇 outer loop steps, indexed by𝑡 = 0,1,··· ,𝑇 −1. At each step𝑡, the goal is to improve the\ncurrent solution𝑠𝑡 to obtain𝑠𝑡+1, optimizing for a performance metricℎ. This process involves two\nmain stages: targeted code block extraction and code block refinement.\nTargeted code block extraction.To effectively explore specialized improvement strategies, MLE-\nSTAR identifies and targets specific code blocks within the ML pipeline represented by𝑠𝑡. This selection\nis guided by an ablation study performed by an agentAabl. Specifically, the agentAabl generates a\ncode 𝑎𝑡 designed to perform an ablation study on𝑠𝑡. This script creates variations of𝑠𝑡 by modifying or\ndisabling specific components. To encourage exploration of different pipeline parts across iterations,\nAabl receives the summaries of previous ablation studies{T𝑖\nabl}𝑡−1\n𝑖=0 as input:\n𝑎𝑡 = Aabl(𝑠𝑡,{T𝑖\nabl}𝑡−1\n𝑖=0 ). (4)\nThen, 𝑎𝑡 is executed, producing output results𝑟𝑡 (see examples in Appendix C). A summarization\nmoduleAsummarize processes the script and its results to generate a concise ablation summaryT𝑡\nabl:\nT𝑡\nabl = Asummarize(𝑎𝑡,𝑟𝑡). (5)\nFinally, MLE-STAR selects a critical block which has the most significant impact on performance. To\nachieve this, an extractor moduleAextractor analyzes theT𝑡\nabl to identify the code block𝑐𝑡 within\n𝑠𝑡 whose modification had the most significant impact on performance. To prioritize refinement of\nblocks not previously targeted, the set of already refined blocks{𝑐𝑖}𝑡−1\n𝑖=0 is provided as context:\n𝑐𝑡,𝑝0 = Aextractor(T𝑡\nabl,𝑠𝑡,{𝑐𝑖}𝑡−1\n𝑖=0 ). (6)\nHere, MLE-STAR also generates the initial plan𝑝0 for code block refinement at the same time, since\nTabl can provide a good starting point by analyzing the modification of corresponding component.\nCode block refinement.Once the targeted code block𝑐𝑡 is defined, MLE-STAR explores various\nrefinement strategies to improve the metricℎ. This involves an inner loop exploring𝐾 potential\nrefinement for𝑐𝑡. An agentAcoder first implements𝑝0, transforming𝑐𝑡 into a refined block𝑐0\n𝑡 , i.e.,\n𝑐0\n𝑡 = Acoder(𝑐𝑡,𝑝0). A candidate solution𝑠0\n𝑡 is formed by substituting𝑐0\n𝑡 into 𝑠𝑡:\n𝑠0\n𝑡 = 𝑠𝑡.replace(𝑐𝑡,𝑐0\n𝑡 ), (7)\n5"}

Standard practice might involve generating multiple candidate solutions and selecting\nthe one with the highest score (Ichihara et al., 2025) according to metricℎ. However, analogous\nto model ensembling, we posit that suboptimal solutions might contain complementary strengths,\nand combining multiple solutions could lead to superior performance compared to relying on any\nsingle one. Therefore, we employ the planning capabilities of MLE-STAR to automatically discover\neffective strategies for ensembling. Specifically, let{𝑠𝑙}𝐿\n𝑙=1 be a set of𝐿 distinct solutions obtained\n(e.g., from parallel runs of the process described earlier). Our goal is to find an effective ensemble\nplan 𝑒that merges these solutions, which mirrors the structure of the targeted code block refinement\nstage. We start with an initial ensemble plan𝑒0 (e.g., a simple strategy like averaging the final\npredictions obtained from the models trained using each solution𝑠𝑙), proposed by MLE-STAR itself.\nAfter the performanceℎ(𝑠0\nens)for the initial plan𝑒0 is calculated, for a fixed number of iterations,\n𝑟 = 1,··· ,𝑅, the planning agentAens_planner, specialized in suggesting ensemble plans, proposes\nsubsequent ensemble plans𝑒𝑟.

Additional modules for robust MLE agents\nDebugging agent.We detail the design of our debugging agent within MLE-STAR. If the execution of\na Python script𝑠 triggers an error, resulting in a recordTbug (e.g., a traceback), MLE-STAR employs a\ndebugging moduleAdebugger to attempt correction. This process iteratively updates the script:\n𝑠←Adebugger(𝑠,Tbug). (10)\nThe debugging step is repeated until either the script executes successfully, or a predefined maximum\nnumber of debugging rounds is reached. If the bug cannot be resolved, MLE-STAR proceeds to the\nnext task using the latest version of the script that is known to be executable.\nData leakage checker.We observe that LLM-generated Python scripts might have the risk of intro-\nducing data leakage, for example, by improperly accessing information from a test dataset during\ntraining dataset preparation (see Figure 6). To address this, we introduce a checker agent,Aleakage,\nwhich analyzes the solution script𝑠prior to its execution. Recognizing that full-script analysis can be\ninefficient for lengthy code, we adopt a targeted approach. First, we extract the code block𝑐data where\ndata preprocessing is done. Second,𝑐data is passed to the checker. IfAleakage detects potential data\nleakage, it generates a corrected version𝑐∗\ndata: 𝑐∗\ndata = Aleakage(𝑐data). Finally, the original script𝑠 is\nupdated by replacing the identified segment with its corrected version:𝑠←𝑠.replace(𝑐data,𝑐∗\ndata). If\nno leakage is detected in𝑐data by Aleakage, the script𝑠 remains unmodified. All generated solutions\nare passed through a data leakage checker,Aleakage, prior to their execution for evaluation.\nData usage checker.We observe that LLM-generated scripts sometimes neglect using provided data\nsources, focusing solely on simple formats like CSVs (see Figure 7). To ensure the utilization of all\nrelevant provided data, MLE-STAR introduces a data usage checker agent,Adata. Specifically, before\nMLE-STAR starts refinement,Adata checks the initial solution𝑠0 along with the task descriptionTtask.\nIf relevant provided data is not adequately used,Adata revises the initial script as:\n𝑠0 ←Adata(𝑠0,Ttask). (11)\n4. Experiments\nIn this section, we validate the effectiveness of MLE-STAR using 22 Kaggle competitions from MLE-\nbench Lite (Chan et al., 2025). Our results demonstrate that MLE-STAR significantly outperforms\nbaselines, including those employing various LLMs (Section 4.1). Furthermore, we show that using\nbetter models and leveraging our proposed ensemble strategy effectively improves performance\n(Section 4.2). We also provide the example solutions generated by MLE-STAR, in Appendix D.\nCommonsetup. Allexperimentsareconductedon22KagglecompetitionsfromMLE-benchLite(Chan\net al., 2025) using three random seeds and Gemini-2.0-Flash, unless otherwise specified. Here, we\nuse an agentAtest, which takes the task description and the final solution as input, and outputs\nthe code that incorporates loading test sample and creating a submission file (see Appendix E for\ndetails). MLE-STAR begins by retrieving four model candidates. MLE-STAR refines for four inner\nloops, while exploring four outer loops. For ensemble, MLE-STAR generates two solutions in parallel,\nand explore ensemble strategies for five rounds. Following the MLE-bench’s setup, we set a maximum\ntime limit of 24 hours for a fair comparison (see computation analysis in Appendix F). We primarily\nconsider AIDE (Jiang et al., 2025) as our main baseline, given its state-of-the-art performance on\nMLE-bench. It is important to note that other baselines often limit their generalizability across various\ntask types (e.g., audio classification, sequence-to-sequence), frequently showcasing results only on\nsimpler modalities like tabular (Hong et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024). For instance, DS-Agent (Guo et al.,"}

Main results\nQuantitative results.As demonstrated in Table 1, MLE-STAR significantly enhances the performance\nof various baseline models. For instance, when applied to Gemini-2.0-Flash, MLE-STAR improves\nAIDE’s any medal achieving rates in Kaggle competitions from 25.8% to 43.9%, representing an\nimprovement of over 18 percentage points, and rate of above median from 39.4% to 63.6%. Notably,\nMLE-STAR with Gemini-2.0-Flash also substantially outperforms AIDE using a powerful reasoning\nmodel (i.e., o1-preview) in terms of achieving gold medals in 10% more tasks. Moreoever, using\nGemini-2.5-Pro, MLE-STAR shows a medal achievement rate of over 60%.\nComparison to DS-Agent.While DS-Agent (Guo et al., 2024) shows competitive results on ML tasks,\nit necessitates human effort to curate its case bank from Kaggle. Consequently, a direct comparison\nbetween DS-Agent and AIDE or our method is not feasible, as collecting tasks across diverse modalities,\nsuch as audio classification or image denoising, requires additional effort. Nevertheless, we utilize four\ntabular classification tasks,i.e., wild-blueberry-yield (WBY), media-campaign-cost (MCC), spaceship-\ntitanic (ST), and enzyme-substrate (ES), the same ones employed during DS-Agent’s development\nstage (Guo et al., 2024), for a comparison. All experiments are done for 5 seeds following the original\nsetup. As shown in Table 2, MLE-STAR using Gemini-2.0-Flash significantly outperforms DS-Agent\neven without human efforts. See Appendix G for additional results, including comparison with\nAutoGluon (Erickson et al., 2020).\n8"}

Ablation studies\nPerformance with reasoning models.First of all, as shown in Table 1, Gemini-2.5-Pro yields better\nperformance than using Gemini-2.0-Flash. For example, in denoising-dirty-documents cometition,\nMLE-STAR wigh Gemini-2.0-Flash scored above the median across all three seeds, failing to achieve\nany medals. However, when using Gemini-2.5-Pro, MLE-STAR achieves two gold medals and one\nsilver medal. These results demonstrate that MLE-STAR is designed to harness the advancements of\nrapidly improving reasoning-based LLMs. In addition, we conducted additional experiments using\nClaude-Sonnet-4 to further address your comments. As shown in the table below, other models besides\nGeminialsoshowpromisingresults, provingcompatibilityandgeneralizabilityintermsofmodeltypes.\nIn addition, as shown in Table 3, MLE-STAR using Claude-Sonnet-4 also shows promising results. Here,\nwe select four different type of competitions: image-to-image (denoising-dirty-documents; DDD),\nimage classification (dog-breed-identification; DBI), text classification (spooky-author-identification,\nSAI), and audio classification (the-icml-2013-whale-challenge-right-whale-redux; WCR). We run\neach competition for three seeds. These results indicates that our frameowkr is also compatible and\ngeneralizable in terms of model types.\nEffectiveness of proposed ensemble method.As highlighted in Table 4, MLE-STAR demonstrates\na significant performance improvement over the competing baseline,i.e., AIDE, achieving over a\n12% higher rate of obtaining any medaleven without additional ensemble strategy. Notably, by\nensembling multiple solution candidates, our approach yields even greater performance gains,i.e.,\nMLE-STAR consistently improves the success rate for achieving any medal (and specifically gold\nmedals), also surpassing the median human expert’s performance by a larger margin compared to\nscenarios where this ensembling method is not used. While simpler strategies, such as selecting\nthe solution with the best validation score or averaging final submissions, also offer benefits, MLE-\nSTAR shows stronger effectiveness,e.g., leading to a higher number of gold medals.\n5. Discussion\nQualitative observations on selected models.Figure 4 illustrates the model usage of two MLE\nagents: AIDE and MLE-STAR. AIDE primarily employs ResNet (He et al., 2016) for image classifica-\ntion. However, ResNet, released in 2015, is now considered outdated and can result in suboptimal\nperformance. In contrast, our MLE-STAR primarily utilizes more recent and competitive models like\nEfficientNet (Tan and Le, 2019) or ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), leading to the performance gain,\nwinning 37% of the medals, more than AIDE, which wins 26% of the image classification challenges.\n9"}

In addition, the improvement process can fail to generalize\nwhen Aleakage is not employed, as exemplified in Table 5. In this example, the validation accuracy\n(i.e., the target objective) improves, but the test accuracy drops significantly. This is attributed to the\nLLM performing feature engineering using the target variableTransported, which is not accessible\nin the test set, leading to data leakage and subsequently, poor test performance.\nWe also observe that LLMs often generate Python scripts that overlook some of the provided\ndata sources. For example, in the nomad2018-predicting competition, Gemini-2.0-Flash solely loads\ntrain.csv, neglecting the use of geometry.xyz (see Figure 7). To address this, MLE-STAR employs\nAdata, which reexamines the task description to ensure that all given data is utilized. As shown\nin Figure 7, this design enables MLE-STAR to incorporate previously neglected data. As a result,\nperformance is significantly improved, as shown in Table 6.\nProgressive improvement via MLE-STAR refinement.This section details the progressive improve-\nment of solutions achieved by MLE-STAR, as measured by validation metrics. Given the task-specific\nnature of evaluation metrics, we report the average relative error reduction (%) across the all 22\nchallenges in MLE-bench Lite (Chan et al., 2025). This metric measures the extent to which MLE-\nSTAR reduces the error of an initial solution. Figure 8 demonstrates a consistent improvement as\nMLE-STAR proceeds through its refinement steps, which each step focusing on refining a single code\nblock via an inner loop. Significantly, the magnitude of improvement is notable in the early refinement\nstages. We posit that this stems from MLE-STAR’s ablation study module which helps to target the\nmost influential code blocks for modification first.\n6. Conclusion\nWe propose MLE-STAR, a novel MLE agent designed for various ML tasks. Our key idea is to utilize a\nsearch engine to retrieve effective models and then explore various strategies targeting specific ML\npipeline components to improve the solution. The effectiveness of MLE-STAR is validated by winning\nmedals in 64% (where 36% are gold medals) of the MLE-bench Lite Kaggle competitions.\nLimitation. Since Kaggle competitions are publicly accessible, there is a potential risk that LLMs\nmight have been trained with the relevant discussions about the challenge. Nevertheless, we show\nthat MLE-STAR’s solution is sufficiently novel (using LLM as a judge) compared to the discussions on\nKaggle (see Appendix H).\n11"}

It should only focus on \ntraining and evaluating the model on the validation set.\n- The code should include a printing statement that shows the performance of each ablation.\n- The code should consequently print out what part of the code contributes the most to the \noverall performance.\nFigure 12|Prompt used for generating a Python script for ablation studies.\nTo effectively explore specialized improvement strategies, MLE-STAR identifies and targets specific\ncode blocks. This code block selection is guided by an ablation study performed by an agentAabl.\nAs shown in Figure 12,Aabl generates a Python code designed to perform an ablation study on\ncurrent solution. The prompt guides the agent to modify or disable specific component.5 Moreover,\nto encourage exploration of different pipeline parts, the summaries of previous ablation studies are\nalso used as valuable feedback. See Appendix C for the example output of the agentAabl.\n5We provide an example generated code for ablation study (which is generated byAabl) inhttps://github.com/\njaehyun513/MLE-STAR (see example_intermediate_outputs/ablation.py).\n18"}

Summary of ablation study\nThe ablation study investigated the impact of three preprocessing steps on the performance of a LightGBM \nclassifier: StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, and Imputation. The baseline model, which included all three \npreprocessing steps, achieved a validation accuracy of 0.8196.\n*   **Ablation 1 (No StandardScaler):** Removing the StandardScaler resulted in a slightly lower validation \naccuracy of 0.8102. This suggests that scaling the numerical features does contribute positively to the model's \nperformance, although the impact is relatively small.\n*   **Ablation 2 (No OneHotEncoder):** Removing the OneHotEncoder led to a more significant drop in validation \naccuracy to 0.7886. This indicates that encoding the categorical features using OneHotEncoder is important for \nthe model's ability to learn from the data.\n*   **Ablation 3 (No Imputation):** Removing the Imputation did not change the validation accuracy, which remained \nat 0.8196. This suggests that the imputation strategy used (mean for numerical and mode for categorical) does not \nhurt the model performance.\nIn summary, the OneHotEncoder has the most significant positive impact on the model's performance, followed by \nthe StandardScaler. The Imputation does not seem to have a significant impact on the model's performance.\nFigure 24|Example of summarized result of ablation study.\nTo parse the information only about the impact of each ML components, MLE-STAR leverages\nAsummarize to summarize the raw output of ablation study such as Figure 23. As a result, we obtain the\nwell-organized summary of the ablation study as shown in Figure 24. Note that such summarization is\nused as input ofAextractor to extract the code block which has most significant impact on performance.\nD.

However, despite the remarkable\nsuccess of large language models, their core architecture is paradoxically shallow 3. This imposes\na fundamental constraint on their most sought-after capability: reasoning. The fixed depth of stan-\ndard Transformers places them in computational complexity classes such asAC0 or TC 0 4, prevent-\ning them from solving problems that require polynomial time 5,6. LLMs are not Turing-complete\nand thus they cannot, at least in a purely end-to-end manner, execute complex algorithmic rea-\nsoning that is necessary for deliberate planning or symbolic manipulation tasks 7,8. For example,\nour results on the Sudoku task show that increasing Transformer model depth can improve per-\nformance,1 but performance remains far from optimal even with very deep models (see Figure 2),\nwhich supports the conjectured limitations of the LLM scaling paradigm9.\nThe LLMs literature has relied largely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for reasoning 10.\nCoT externalizes reasoning into token-level language by breaking down complex tasks into sim-\npler intermediate steps, sequentially generating text using a shallow model 11. However, CoT for\nreasoning is a crutch, not a satisfactory solution. It relies on brittle, human-defined decompositions\nwhere a single misstep or a misorder of the steps can derail the reasoning process entirely12,13. This\ndependency on explicit linguistic steps tethers reasoning to patterns at the token level. As a result,\nCoT reasoning often requires significant amount of training data and generates a large number of\ntokens for complex reasoning tasks, resulting in slow response times. A more efficient approach is\nneeded to minimize these data requirements14.\nTowards this goal, we explore “latent reasoning”, where the model conducts computations within\nits internal hidden state space 15,16. This aligns with the understanding that language is a tool for\nhuman communication, not the substrate of thought itself 17; the brain sustains lengthy, coherent\nchains of reasoning with remarkable efficiency in a latent space, without constant translation back\nto language. However, the power of latent reasoning is still fundamentally constrained by a model’s\neffective computational depth. Naively stacking layers is notoriously difficult due to vanishing gra-\ndients, which plague training stability and effectiveness 1,18. Recurrent architectures, a natural al-\nternative for sequential tasks, often suffer from early convergence, rendering subsequent computa-\ntional steps inert, and rely on the biologically implausible, computationally expensive and memory\nintensive Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) for training19.\nThe human brain provides a compelling blueprint for achieving the effective computational depth\nthat contemporary artificial models lack. It organizes computation hierarchically across corti-\ncal regions operating at different timescales, enabling deep, multi-stage reasoning 20,21,22. Recur-\nrent feedback loops iteratively refine internal representations, allowing slow, higher-level areas to\nguide, and fast, lower-level circuits to execute—subordinate processing while preserving global\ncoherence23,24,25. Notably, the brain achieves such depth without incurring the prohibitive credit-\nassignment costs that typically hamper recurrent networks from backpropagation through time19,26.\nInspired by this hierarchical and multi-timescale biological architecture, we propose the Hierar-\nchical Reasoning Model (HRM). HRM is designed to significantly increase the effective compu-\ntational depth. It features two coupled recurrent modules: a high-level (H) module for abstract,\ndeliberate reasoning, and a low-level (L) module for fast, detailed computations. This structure\n1Simply increasing the model width does not improve performance here.\n2"}

Left:On Sudoku-Extreme Full, which\nrequire extensive tree-search and backtracking, increasing a Transformer’s width yields no perfor-\nmance gain, while increasing depth is critical. Right: Standard architectures saturates, failing to\nbenefit from increased depth. HRM overcomes this fundamental limitation, effectively using its\ncomputational depth to achieve near-perfect accuracy.\navoids the rapid convergence of standard recurrent models through a process we term “hierarchi-\ncal convergence.” The slow-updating H-module advances only after the fast-updating L-module\nhas completed multiple computational steps and reached a local equilibrium, at which point the\nL-module is reset to begin a new computational phase.\nFurthermore, we propose a one-step gradient approximation for training HRM, which offers im-\nproved efficiency and eliminates the requirement for BPTT. This design maintains a constant mem-\nory footprint ( O(1) compared to BPTT’s O(T) for T timesteps) throughout the backpropagation\nprocess, making it scalable and more biologically plausible.\nLeveraging its enhanced effective depth, HRM excels at tasks that demand extensive search and\nbacktracking. Using only 1,000 input-output examples, without pre-training or CoT supervi-\nsion, HRM learns to solve problems that are intractable for even the most advanced LLMs. For\nexample, it achieves near-perfect accuracy in complex Sudoku puzzles (Sudoku-Extreme Full) and\noptimal pathfinding in 30x30 mazes, where state-of-the-art CoT methods completely fail (0% ac-\ncuracy). In the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) AGI Challenge 27,28,29 - a benchmark\nof inductive reasoning - HRM, trained from scratch with only the official dataset (~1000 exam-\nples), with only 27M parameters and a 30x30 grid context (900 tokens), achieves a performance\nof 40.3%, which substantially surpasses leading CoT-based models like o3-mini-high (34.5%)\nand Claude 3.7 8K context (21.2%), despite their considerably larger parameter sizes and con-\ntext lengths, as shown in Figure 1.

First, the input x is\nprojected into a working representation ˜x by the input network:\n˜x = fI(x; θI) .\nAt each timestep i, the L-module updates its state conditioned on its own previous state, the H-\nmodule’s current state (which remains fixed throughout the cycle), and the input representation.\nThe H-module only updates once per cycle (i.e., every T timesteps) using the L-module’s final\nstate at the end of that cycle:\nzi\nL = fL\n\u0000\nzi−1\nL , zi−1\nH , ˜x; θL\n\u0001\n,\nzi\nH =\n(\nfH\n\u0000\nzi−1\nH , zi−1\nL ; θH\n\u0001\nif i ≡ 0 (mod T) ,\nzi−1\nH otherwise .\nFinally, after N full cycles, a prediction ˆy is extracted from the hidden state of the H-module:\nˆy = fO(zNT\nH ; θO) .\nThis entire NT -timestep process represents a single forward pass of the HRM. A halting mecha-\nnism (detailed later in this section) determines whether the model should terminate, in which case\nˆy will be used as the final prediction, or continue with an additional forward pass.\nHierarchical convergenceAlthough convergence is crucial for recurrent networks, standard RNNs\nare fundamentally limited by their tendency to converge too early. As the hidden state settles toward\na fixed point, update magnitudes shrink, effectively stalling subsequent computation and capping\nthe network’s effective depth. To preserve computational power, we actually want convergence to\nproceed very slowly–but engineering that gradual approach is difficult, since pushing convergence\ntoo far edges the system toward instability.\n2While inspired by temporal separation in the brain, our model’s “high-level” and “low-level” modules are concep-\ntual abstractions and do not map directly to specific neural oscillation frequencies.\n4"}

HRM shows hierarchical conver-\ngence: the H-module steadily converges, while the L-module repeatedly converges within cycles\nbefore being reset by H, resulting in residual spikes. The recurrent neural network exhibits rapid\nconvergence with residuals quickly approaching zero. In contrast, the deep neural network experi-\nences vanishing gradients, with significant residuals primarily in the initial (input) and final layers.\nHRM is explicitly designed to counteract this premature convergence through a process we term\nhierarchical convergence. During each cycle, the L-module (an RNN) exhibits stable convergence\nto a local equilibrium. This equilibrium, however, depends on the high-level state zH supplied\nduring that cycle. After completing the T steps, the H-module incorporates the sub-computation’s\noutcome (the final statezL) and performs its own update. ThiszH update establishes a fresh context\nfor the L-module, essentially “restarting” its computational path and initiating a new convergence\nphase toward a different local equilibrium.\nThis process allows the HRM to perform a sequence of distinct, stable, nested computations, where\nthe H-module directs the overall problem-solving strategy and the L-module executes the intensive\nsearch or refinement required for each step. Although a standard RNN may approach convergence\nwithin T iterations, the hierarchical convergence benefits from an enhanced effective depth of NT\nsteps. As empirically shown in Figure 3, this mechanism allows HRM both to maintain high\ncomputational activity (forward residual) over many steps (in contrast to a standard RNN, whose\nactivity rapidly decays) and to enjoy stable convergence. This translates into better performance at\nany computation depth, as illustrated in Figure 2.\nApproximate gradient Recurrent models typically use BPTT to compute gradients. However,\nBPTT requires storing the hidden states from the forward pass and then combining them with\ngradients during the backward pass, which demands O(T) memory for T timesteps. This heavy\nmemory burden forces smaller batch sizes and leads to poor GPU utilization, especially for large-\nscale networks. Additionally, because retaining the full history trace through time is biologically\nimplausible, it is unlikely that the brain implements BPTT19.\nFortunately, if a recurrent neural network converges to a fixed point, we can avoid unrolling its state\nsequence by applying backpropagation in a single step at that equilibrium point. Moreover, such a\nmechanism could plausibly be implemented in the brain using only local learning rules34,35. Based\n5"}

Let M denote the total number of segments executed before termination.\nFor each segment m ∈ {1, . . . , M}, let zm = ( zmNT\nH , zmNT\nL ) represent the hidden state at the\nconclusion of segment m, encompassing both high-level and low-level state components.\nAt each segment m, we apply a deep supervision step as follows:\n1. Given the state zm−1 from the previous segment, compute the next statezm and its associated\noutput ˆym through a forward pass in the HRM model:\n(zm, ˆym) ← HRM(zm−1, x; θ)\n2. Compute the loss for the current segment:\nLm ← LOSS (ˆym, y)\n3. Update parameters:\nθ ← OPTIMIZER STEP (θ, ∇θLm)\nThe crucial aspect of this procedure is that the hidden state zm is “detached” from the computa-\ntion graph before being used as the input state for the next segment. Consequently, gradients from\nsegment m + 1 do not propagate back through segment m, effectively creating a 1-step approxi-\nmation of the gradient of the recursive deep supervision process39,40. This approach provides more\nfrequent feedback to the H-module and serves as a regularization mechanism, demonstrating supe-\nrior empirical performance and enhanced stability in deep equilibrium models when compared to\nmore complex, Jacobian-based regularization techniques 39,41.

Neuroscientific evidence shows that\nthese cognitive modes share overlapping neural circuits, particularly within regions such as the\nprefrontal cortex and the default mode network43,44. This indicates that the brain dynamically mod-\nulates the “runtime” of these circuits according to task complexity and potential rewards45,46.\nInspired by the above mechanism, we incorporate an adaptive halting strategy into HRM that en-\nables “thinking, fast and slow”. This integration leverages deep supervision and uses the Q-learning\n7"}

A Q-head uses the final state of the\nH-module to predict the Q-values ˆQm = ( ˆQm\nhalt, ˆQm\ncontinue) of the “halt” and “continue” actions:\nˆQm = σ(θ⊤\nQzmNT\nH ) ,\nwhere σ denotes the sigmoid function applied element-wise. The halt or continue action is chosen\nusing a randomized strategy as detailed next. Let Mmax denote the maximum number of segments\n(a fixed hyperparameter) and Mmin denote the minimum number of segments (a random variable).\nThe value ofMmin is determined stochastically: with probabilityε, it is sampled uniformly from the\nset {2, ··· , Mmax} (to encourage longer thinking), and with probability1−ε, it is set to 1. The halt\naction is selected under two conditions: when the segment count surpasses the maximum threshold\nMmax, or when the estimated halt value ˆQhalt exceeds the estimated continue value ˆQcontinue and the\nsegment count has reached at least the minimum threshold Mmin.\nThe Q-head is updated through a Q-learning algorithm, which is defined on the following episodic\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP). The state of the MDP at segment m is zm, and the action space\nis {halt, continue}. Choosing the action “halt” terminates the episode and returns a binary reward\nindicating prediction correctness, i.e., 1{ˆym = y}. Choosing “continue” yields a reward of 0 and\nthe state transitions to zm+1. Thus, the Q-learning targets for the two actions ˆGm = ( ˆGm\nhalt, ˆGm\ncontinue)\nare given by\nˆGm\nhalt = 1{ˆym = y},\nˆGm\ncontinue =\n\n\n\nˆQm+1\nhalt , if m ≥ Nmax ,\nmax( ˆQm+1\nhalt , ˆQm+1\ncontinue) , otherwise .\nWe can now define the loss function of our learning procedure. The overall loss for each supervision\nsegment combines both the Q-head loss and the sequence-to-sequence loss:\nLm\nACT = LOSS (ˆym, y) + BINARY CROSS ENTROPY ( ˆQm, ˆGm) .\nMinimizing the above loss enables both accurate predictions and nearly optimal stopping decisions.\nSelecting the “halt” action ends the supervision loop. In practice, sequences are processed in\nbatches, which can be easily handled by substituting any halted sample in the batch with a fresh\nsample from the dataloader.\nFigure 5 presents a performance comparison between two HRM variants: one incorporating ACT\nand another employing a fixed computational step count equivalent to ACT’s Mmax parameter. It\nshows that ACT effectively adapts its computational resources based on task complexity, achieving\nsignificant computational savings with minimal impact on performance.\nInference-time scaling An effective neural model should exploit additional computational re-\nsources during inference to enhance performance. As illustrated in Figure 5-(c), HRM seamlessly\nachieves inference-time scaling by simply increasing the computational limit parameter, Mmax\nwithout requiring further training or architectural modifications.\nAdditional compute is especially effective for tasks that demand deeper reasoning. On Sudoku—\na problem that often requires long-term planning—HRM exhibits strong inference-time scaling.\nOn the other hand, we find that extra computational resources yield minimal gains in ARC-AGI\nchallenge, as solutions generally require only a few transformations.\n8"}

For example, a model trained with\nMmax = 8 continues to see accuracy gains when run with Mmax = 16 during inference.\nStability of Q-learning in ACTThe deep Q-learning that underpins our ACT mechanism is\nknown to be prone to instability, often requiring stabilization techniques such as replay buffers\nand target networks 48, which are absent in our design. Our approach, however, achieves stability\nthrough the intrinsic properties of our model and training procedure. Recent theoretical work by\nGallici et al.49 shows that Q-learning can achieve convergence if network parameters are bounded,\nweight decay is incorporated during training, and post-normalization layers are implemented. Our\nmodel satisfies these conditions through its Post-Norm architecture that employs RMSNorm (a\nlayer normalization variant) and the AdamW optimizer. AdamW has been shown to solve an L∞-\nconstrained optimization problem, ensuring that model parameters remain bounded by 1/λ50.\nArchitectural details We employ a sequence-to-sequence architecture for HRM. Both input and\noutput are represented as token sequences: x = ( x1, . . . , xl) and y = ( y1, . . . , yl′) respectively.\nThe model includes an embedding layer fI that converts discrete tokens into vector representa-\ntions, and an output head fO(z; θO) = softmax(θOz) that transforms hidden states into token prob-\nability distributions ˆy. For small-sample experiments, we replace softmax with stablemax 51 to\nimprove generalization performance. The sequence-to-sequence loss is averaged over all tokens,\nLOSS (ˆy, y) = 1\nl′\nPl′\ni=1 log p(yi), where p(yi) is the probability that distribution ˆyi assigns to token\nyi. The initial hidden states z0 are initialized by sampling from a truncated normal distribution with\nstandard deviation of 1, truncation of 2, and kept fixed throughout training.\nBoth the low-level and high-level recurrent modules fL and fH are implemented using encoder-\nonly Transformer52 blocks with identical architectures and dimensions. These modules take mul-\ntiple inputs, and we use straightforward element-wise addition to combine them, though more\nsophisticated merging techniques such as gating mechanisms could potentially improve perfor-\nmance and is left for future work. For all Transformer blocks in this work—including those in\nthe baseline models—we incorporate the enhancements found in modern LLMs (based on Llama53\narchitectures). These improvements include Rotary Positional Encoding 54, Gated Linear Units 55,\nRMSNorm56, and the removal of bias terms from linear layers.\nFurthermore, both HRM and recurrent Transformer models implement a Post-Norm architecture\n9"}

Figure 6-(a,b,c) presents a visual representa-\ntion of the three benchmark tasks, which are selected to evaluate various reasoning abilities in AI\nmodels.\n3.1 Benchmarks\nARC-AGI Challenge The ARC-AGI benchmark evaluates general fluid intelligence through IQ-\ntest-like puzzles that require inductive reasoning27. The initial version, ARC-AGI-1, presents chal-\nlenges as input-output grid pairs that force AI systems to extract and generalize abstract rules from\njust a few examples. Each task provides a few input–output example pairs (usually 2–3) and a test\ninput. An AI model has two attempts to produce the correct output grid. Although some believe\nthat mastering ARC-AGI would signal true artificial general intelligence, its primary purpose is\nto expose the current roadblocks in AGI progress. In fact, both conventional deep learning meth-\nods and CoT techniques have faced significant challenges with ARC-AGI-1, primarily because it\nrequires the ability to generalize to entirely new tasks28.\nAddressing the limitations identified in ARC-AGI-1, ARC-AGI-2 significantly expands the bench-\nmark by providing a more comprehensive and carefully refined collection of tasks.

A prediction is considered correct if it exactly matches the\npuzzle’s unique solution. Sudoku’s complex logical structure makes it a popular benchmark for\nevaluating logical reasoning in machine learning62,63,64.\nThe most frequently used Sudoku dataset in research, namely the Kaggle dataset 65, can be fully\nsolved using elementary single-digit techniques66. The minimal 17-clue puzzles62, another widely-\nused collection, might seem more challenging due to its small number of clues. However, this\nperception is misleading—since 17 represents the minimum number of clues required to guarantee\na unique Sudoku solution, these hints need to be highly orthogonal to each other. This orthogonal\narrangement leads to many direct, easily-resolved solution paths67.\nWe introduce Sudoku-Extreme, a more challenging dataset that is compiled from the aforemen-\ntioned easy datasets as well as puzzles recognized by the Sudoku community as exceptionally\ndifficult for human players:\n• Easy puzzles compiled from Kaggle, 17-clue, plus unbiased samples from the Sudoku puzzle\ndistribution67: totaling 1 149 158puzzles.\n• Challenging puzzles compiled from Magictour 1465, Forum-Hard and Forum-Extreme subsets:\ntotaling 3 104 157puzzles.\nThe compiled data then undergo a strict 90/10 train-test split, ensuring that the test set puzzles\ncannot be derived through equivalent transformations of any training samples. Sudoku-Extreme is\na down-sampled subset of this data containing 1000 training examples. We use Sudoku-Extreme in\nour main experiments (Figure 1), which focuses on small-sample learning scenarios. To guarantee\nconvergence and control overfitting effects in our analysis experiments (Figures 2, 3 and 5), we use\nthe complete training data, Sudoku-Extreme-Full, containing 3 831 994examples.\nWe measure puzzle difficulty by counting the number of search backtracks (“guesses”) required\nby a smart Sudoku solver program tdoku, which uses propositional logic to reduce the number of\nguesses67. Our Sudoku-Extreme dataset exhibits a mean difficulty of 22 backtracks per puzzle, sig-\nnificantly higher than existing datasets, including recent handmade puzzles Sudoku-Bench68 which\naverage just 0.45 backtracks per puzzle. These subset complexity levels are shown in Figure 6-(d).\nMaze-Hard This task involves finding the optimal path in a 30 ×30 maze, making it interpretable\nand frequently used for training LLMs in search tasks 69,70,71. We adopt the instance generation\nprocedure of Lehnert et al.71, but introduce an additional filter to retain only those instances whose\ndifficulty exceeds 110. Here, “difficulty” is defined as the length of the shortest path, which aligns\nwith the linear time complexity of the wavefront breadth-first search algorithm on GPUs72. A path\nis considered correct if it is valid and optimal—that is, the shortest route from the start to the goal.\nThe training and test set both include 1000 examples.\n3.2 Evaluation Details\nFor all benchmarks, HRM models were initialized with random weights and trained in the sequence-\nto-sequence setup using the input-output pairs. The two-dimensional input and output grids were\nflattened and then padded to the maximum sequence length. The resulting performance is shown in\nFigure 1. Remarkably, HRM attains these results with just ~1000 training examples per task—and\nwithout pretraining or CoT labels.\n11"}

The dataset is augmented by applying translations, rotations, flips, and color permutations\nto the puzzles. Each task example is prepended with a learnable special token that represents the\npuzzle it belongs to. At test time, we proceed as follows for each test input in the evaluation set: (1)\nGenerate and solve 1000 augmented variants and, for each, apply the inverse-augmentation trans-\nform to obtain a prediction. (2) Choose the two most popular predictions as the final outputs. 3 All\nresults are reported on the evaluation set.\nWe augment Sudoku puzzles by applying band and digit permutations, while data augmentation is\ndisabled for Maze tasks. Both tasks undergo only a single inference pass.\nFor ARC-AGI, the scores of the CoT models are taken from the official leaderboard 29, while for\nSudoku and Maze, the scores are obtained by evaluating through the corresponding API.\nIn Figure 1, the baselines are grouped based on whether they are pre-trained and use CoT, or neither.\nThe “Direct pred” baseline means using “direct prediction without CoT and pre-training”, which\nretains the exact training setup of HRM but swaps in a Transformer architecture. Interestingly, on\nARC-AGI-1, “Direct pred” matches the performance of Liao and Gu 73 , who built a carefully de-\nsigned, domain-specific equivariant network for learning the ARC-AGI task from scratch, without\npre-training. By substituting the Transformer architecture with HRM’s hierarchical framework and\nimplementing ACT, we achieve more than a twofold performance improvement.\nOn the Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard benchmarks, the performance gap between HRM and the\nbaseline methods is significant, as the baselines almost never manage to solve the tasks. These\nbenchmarks that demand lengthy reasoning traces are particularly difficult for CoT-based methods.\nWith only 1000 training examples, the “Direct pred” baseline—which employs an 8-layer Trans-\nformer identical in size to HRM—fails entirely on these challenging reasoning problems. When\ntrained on the larger Sudoku-Extreme-Full dataset, however, “Direct pred” can solve some easy\nSudoku puzzles and reaches 16.9% accuracy (see Figure 2). Lehnert et al. 71 showed that a large\nvanilla Transformer model with 175M parameters, trained on 1 million examples across multiple\ntrials, achieved only marginal success on 30x30 Maze tasks, with accuracy below 20% using the\npass@64 evaluation metric.\n3.3 Visualization of intermediate timesteps\nAlthough HRM demonstrates strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, it raises an intrigu-\ning question: what underlying reasoning algorithms does the HRM neural network actually imple-\nment? Addressing this question is important for enhancing model interpretability and developing a\ndeeper understanding of the HRM solution space.\nWhile a definitive answer lies beyond our current scope, we begin our investigation by analyzing\nstate trajectories and their corresponding solution evolution. More specifically, at each timestep\ni and given the low-level and high-level state pair ( zi\nL and zi\nH) we perform a preliminary forward\npass through the H-module to obtain¯zi = fH(zi\nH, zi\nL; θH) and its corresponding decoded prediction\n¯yi = fO(¯zi; θO). The prediction ¯yi is then visualized in Figure 7.\nIn the Maze task, HRM appears to initially explore several potential paths simultaneously, subse-\nquently eliminating blocked or inefficient routes, then constructing a preliminary solution outline\nfollowed by multiple refinement iterations. In Sudoku, the strategy resembles a depth-first search\n3The ARC-AGI allows two attempts for each test input.\n12"}

HRM uses a different approach for ARC tasks, making incremental adjustments to the board\nand iteratively improving it until reaching a solution. Unlike Sudoku, which involves frequent\nbacktracking, the ARC solution path follows a more consistent progression similar to hill-climbing\noptimization.\nImportantly, the model shows that it can adapt to different reasoning approaches, likely choosing an\neffective strategy for each particular task. Further research is needed to gain more comprehensive\ninsights into these solution strategies.\n4 Brain Correspondence\nA key principle from systems neuroscience is that a brain region’s functional repertoire—its ability\nto handle diverse and complex tasks—is closely linked to the dimensionality of its neural represen-\ntations75,76. Higher-order cortical areas, responsible for complex reasoning and decision-making,\nmust handle a wide variety of tasks, demanding more flexible and context-dependent processing77.\nIn dynamical systems, this flexibility is often realized through higher-dimensional state-space tra-\njectories, which allow for a richer repertoire of potential computations 78. This principle gives rise\nto an observable dimensionality hierarchy, where a region’s position in the processing hierarchy\ncorrelates with its effective dimensionality. To quantify this phenomenon, we can examine the\n13"}

The PR is calculated using the formula\nPR = (P\ni λi)2\nP\ni λ2\ni\n,\nwhere {λi} are the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of neural trajectories. Intuitively, a higher\nPR value signifies that variance is distributed more evenly across many dimensions, corresponding\nto a higher-dimensional representation. Conversely, a lower PR value indicates that variance is\nconcentrated in only a few principal components, reflecting a more compact, lower-dimensional\nstructure.\nThe dimensionality hierarchy can be observed, for example, in the mouse cortex, where the PR of\npopulation activity increases monotonically from low-level sensory areas to high-level associative\nareas, supporting this link between dimensionality and functional complexity74 (Figure 8 (a,b)).\nWe evaluated whether HRM reproduces this neuroscientific principle by calculating the PR for\nboth recurrent modules after training on the Sudoku-Extreme Full dataset. The PR computation\nused the covariance matrix derived from neural states gathered across multiple Sudoku-solving\ntrajectories. The results show a striking parallel to the biological findings. The low-level module’s\nstate (zL) occupies a relatively small subspace with a participation ratio of 30.22, whereas the high-\nlevel module’s state ( zH) operates in a substantially larger subspace with a participation ratio of\n89.95, as shown in Figure 8(c). Furthermore, Figure 8(d) shows that increasing the number of\nunique tasks (trajectories) from 10 to 100 causes zH dimensionality to scale up accordingly, while\nzL dimensionality remains stable. These results suggest an emergent separation of representational\ncapacity between the modules that parallels their functional roles.\nTo confirm that this hierarchical organization is an emergent property of training, and not an artifact\nof the network’s architecture, we performed a control analysis using an identical but untrained\nnetwork with random weights.\nWe initialized an identical HRM architecture with random weights and, without any training, mea-\nsured the PR of its modules as the network processed the same task-specific inputs given to the\ntrained model.\nThe results, shown in Figure 8(e,f), reveal a stark contrast: the high-level and low-level modules of\nthe untrained network exhibit no hierarchical separation, with their PR values remaining low and\nnearly indistinguishable from each other. This control analysis validates that the dimensionality\nhierarchy is an emergent property that arises as the model learns to perform complex reasoning.\nThe high-to-low PR ratio in HRM ( zH/zL ≈ 2.98) closely matches that measured in the mouse\ncortex (≈ 2.25). In contrast, conventional deep networks often exhibit neural collapse, where\nlast-layer features converge to a low-dimensional subspace80,81,82. HRM therefore departs from the\ncollapse pattern and instead fosters a high-dimensional representation in its higher module. This\nis significant because such representations are considered crucial for cognitive flexibility and are a\nhallmark of higher-order brain regions like the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is central to complex\nreasoning.\nThis structural parallel suggests the model has discovered a fundamental organizational principle.\nBy learning to partition its representations into a high-capacity, high-dimensional subspace ( zH)\nand a more specialized, low-dimensional one (zL), HRM autonomously discovers an organizational\n15"}

This provides a potential mechanistic explanation for the model’s success on complex,\nlong-horizon tasks that are intractable for models lacking such a differentiated internal structure.\nWe emphasize, however, that this evidence is correlational. While a causal link could be tested\nvia intervention (e.g., by constraining the H-module’s dimensionality), such methods are difficult\nto interpret in deep learning due to potential confounding effects on the training process itself.\nThus, the causal necessity of this emergent hierarchy remains an important question for future\ninvestigation.\n5 Related Work\nReasoning and algorithm learningGiven the central role of reasoning problems and their close\nrelation to algorithms, researchers have long explored neural architectures that enable algorithm\nlearning from training instances. This line of work includes Neural Turing Machines (NTM) 83,\nthe Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) 84, and Neural GPUs 85–all of which construct iterative\nneural architectures that mimic computational hardware for algorithm execution, and are trained to\nlearn algorithms from data. Another notable work in this area is Recurrent Relational Networks\n(RRN)62, which executes algorithms on graph representations through graph neural networks.\nRecent studies have integrated algorithm learning approaches with Transformer-based architec-\ntures. Universal Transformers extend the standard Transformer model by introducing a recurrent\nloop over the layers and implementing an adaptive halting mechanism. Geiping et al.86 demonstrate\nthat looped Transformers can generalize to a larger number of recurrent steps during inference than\nwhat they were trained on. Shen et al. 16 propose adding continuous recurrent reasoning tokens\nto the Transformer. Finally, TransNAR 8 combine recurrent graph neural networks with language\nmodels.\nBuilding on the success of CoT-based reasoning, a line of work have introduced fine-tuning meth-\nods that use reasoning paths from search algorithms (like A*) as SFT targets87,71,70.\nWe also mention adaptive halting mechanisms designed to allocate additional computational re-\nsources to more challenging problems. This includes the Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) for\nRNNs88 and follow-up research like PonderNet89, which aims to improve the stability of this allo-\ncation process.\nHRM further pushes the boundary of algorithm learning through a brain-inspired computational\narchitecture that achieves exceptional data efficiency and model expressiveness, successfully dis-\ncovering complex and diverse algorithms from just 1000 training examples.\nBrain-inspired reasoning architecturesDeveloping a model with the reasoning power of the\nbrain has long been a goal in brain-inspired computing. Spaun90 is one notable example, which uses\nspiking neural networks to create distinct modules corresponding to brain regions like the visual\ncortex and prefrontal cortex. This design enables an architecture to perform a range of cognitive\ntasks, from memory recall to simple reasoning puzzles. However, its reasoning relies on hand-\ndesigned algorithms, which may limit its ability to learn new tasks.

Another approach involves neural sampling models92, which view the neural signaling\nprocess as inference over a distribution, functioning similarly to a Boltzmann machine. These\nmodels often require hand-made rules to be set up for solving a specific reasoning task. In essence,\nwhile prior models are restricted to simple reasoning problems, HRM is designed to solve complex\ntasks that are hard for even advanced LLMs, without pre-training or task-specific manual design.\nHierarchical memory The hierarchical multi-timescale structure also plays an important role in\nhow the brain processes memory. Models such as Hierarchical Sequential Models93 and Clockwork\nRNN94 use multiple recurrent modules that operate at varying time scales to more effectively cap-\nture long-range dependencies within sequences, thereby mitigating the forgetting issue in RNNs.\nSimilar mechanisms have also been adopted in linear attention methods for memorizing long con-\ntexts (see the Discussions section). Since HRM focuses on reasoning, full attention is applied for\nsimplicity. Incorporating hierarchical memory into HRM could be a promising future direction.\n6 Discussions\nTuring-completeness of HRMLike earlier neural reasoning algorithms including the Universal\nTransformer95, HRM is computationally universal when given sufficient memory and time con-\nstraints. In other words, it falls into the category of models that can simulate any Turing machine,\novercoming the computational limitations of standard Transformers discussed previously in the in-\ntroduction. Given that earlier neural algorithm reasoners were trained as recurrent neural networks,\nthey suffer from premature convergence and memory intensive BPTT. Therefore, in practice, their\neffective computational depth remains limited, though still deeper than that of a standard Trans-\nformer. By resolving these two challenges and being equipped with adaptive computation, HRM\ncould be trained on long reasoning processes, solve complex puzzles requiring intensive depth-first\nsearch and backtracking, and move closer to practical Turing-completeness.\nReinforcement learning with chain-of-thoughtBeyond fine-tuning using human-annotated CoT,\nreinforcement learning (RL) represents another widely adopted training methodology. However,\nrecent evidence suggests that RL primarily unlocks existing CoT-like capabilities rather than dis-\ncovering fundamentally new reasoning mechanisms 96,97,98,99. Additionally, CoT-training with RL\nis known for its instability and data inefficiency, often requiring extensive exploration and careful\nreward design. In contrast, HRM takes feedback from dense gradient-based supervision rather than\nrelying on a sparse reward signal. Moreover, HRM operates naturally in a continuous space, which\nis biologically plausible and avoids allocating same computational resources to each token, even\nthough tokens vary in their reasoning and planning complexity16.\nLinear attention Recurrence has been explored not only for its capability in universal computa-\ntion, but also as a means to replace the attention mechanism in Transformers, which suffers from\nquadratic time and memory complexity 100. Recurrent alternatives offer a more efficient design by\nprocessing input tokens sequentially and predicting the next token at each time step, similar to early\nRNN-based language models.\nSome linear-attention variants, such as Log-linear Attention101, share an RNN-like state-update that\ncan be interpreted as propagating multi-timescale summary statistics, thereby retaining long-range\ncontext without the quadratic memory growth of standard self-attention. However, substituting the\nattention mechanism alone does not change the fact that Transformers are still fixed-depth, and\nrequire CoT as a compensatory mechanism. Notably, linear attention can operate with a reduced\n17"}

With only 27M parameters and train-\ning on just 1000 examples, HRM effectively solves challenging reasoning problems such as ARC,\nSudoku, and complex maze navigation–tasks that typically pose significant difficulties for contem-\nporary LLM and chain-of-thought models.\nAlthough the brain relies heavily on hierarchical structures to enable most cognitive processes,\nthese concepts have largely remained confined to academic literature rather than being translated\ninto practical applications. The prevailing AI approach continues to favor non-hierarchical models.\nOur results challenge this established paradigm and suggest that the Hierarchical Reasoning Model\nrepresents a viable alternative to the currently dominant chain-of-thought reasoning methods, ad-\nvancing toward a foundational framework capable of Turing-complete universal computation.\nAcknowledgements We thank Mingli Yuan, Ahmed Murtadha Hasan Mahyoub and Hengshuai\nYao for their insightful discussions and valuable feedback throughout the course of this work.\n18"}

However, despite the remarkable\nsuccess of large language models, their core architecture is paradoxically shallow 3. This imposes\na fundamental constraint on their most sought-after capability: reasoning. The fixed depth of stan-\ndard Transformers places them in computational complexity classes such asAC0 or TC 0 4, prevent-\ning them from solving problems that require polynomial time 5,6. LLMs are not Turing-complete\nand thus they cannot, at least in a purely end-to-end manner, execute complex algorithmic rea-\nsoning that is necessary for deliberate planning or symbolic manipulation tasks 7,8. For example,\nour results on the Sudoku task show that increasing Transformer model depth can improve per-\nformance,1 but performance remains far from optimal even with very deep models (see Figure 2),\nwhich supports the conjectured limitations of the LLM scaling paradigm9.\nThe LLMs literature has relied largely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for reasoning 10.\nCoT externalizes reasoning into token-level language by breaking down complex tasks into sim-\npler intermediate steps, sequentially generating text using a shallow model 11. However, CoT for\nreasoning is a crutch, not a satisfactory solution. It relies on brittle, human-defined decompositions\nwhere a single misstep or a misorder of the steps can derail the reasoning process entirely12,13. This\ndependency on explicit linguistic steps tethers reasoning to patterns at the token level. As a result,\nCoT reasoning often requires significant amount of training data and generates a large number of\ntokens for complex reasoning tasks, resulting in slow response times. A more efficient approach is\nneeded to minimize these data requirements14.\nTowards this goal, we explore “latent reasoning”, where the model conducts computations within\nits internal hidden state space 15,16. This aligns with the understanding that language is a tool for\nhuman communication, not the substrate of thought itself 17; the brain sustains lengthy, coherent\nchains of reasoning with remarkable efficiency in a latent space, without constant translation back\nto language. However, the power of latent reasoning is still fundamentally constrained by a model’s\neffective computational depth. Naively stacking layers is notoriously difficult due to vanishing gra-\ndients, which plague training stability and effectiveness 1,18. Recurrent architectures, a natural al-\nternative for sequential tasks, often suffer from early convergence, rendering subsequent computa-\ntional steps inert, and rely on the biologically implausible, computationally expensive and memory\nintensive Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) for training19.\nThe human brain provides a compelling blueprint for achieving the effective computational depth\nthat contemporary artificial models lack. It organizes computation hierarchically across corti-\ncal regions operating at different timescales, enabling deep, multi-stage reasoning 20,21,22. Recur-\nrent feedback loops iteratively refine internal representations, allowing slow, higher-level areas to\nguide, and fast, lower-level circuits to execute—subordinate processing while preserving global\ncoherence23,24,25. Notably, the brain achieves such depth without incurring the prohibitive credit-\nassignment costs that typically hamper recurrent networks from backpropagation through time19,26.\nInspired by this hierarchical and multi-timescale biological architecture, we propose the Hierar-\nchical Reasoning Model (HRM). HRM is designed to significantly increase the effective compu-\ntational depth. It features two coupled recurrent modules: a high-level (H) module for abstract,\ndeliberate reasoning, and a low-level (L) module for fast, detailed computations. This structure\n1Simply increasing the model width does not improve performance here.\n2"}

Left:On Sudoku-Extreme Full, which\nrequire extensive tree-search and backtracking, increasing a Transformer’s width yields no perfor-\nmance gain, while increasing depth is critical. Right: Standard architectures saturates, failing to\nbenefit from increased depth. HRM overcomes this fundamental limitation, effectively using its\ncomputational depth to achieve near-perfect accuracy.\navoids the rapid convergence of standard recurrent models through a process we term “hierarchi-\ncal convergence.” The slow-updating H-module advances only after the fast-updating L-module\nhas completed multiple computational steps and reached a local equilibrium, at which point the\nL-module is reset to begin a new computational phase.\nFurthermore, we propose a one-step gradient approximation for training HRM, which offers im-\nproved efficiency and eliminates the requirement for BPTT. This design maintains a constant mem-\nory footprint ( O(1) compared to BPTT’s O(T) for T timesteps) throughout the backpropagation\nprocess, making it scalable and more biologically plausible.\nLeveraging its enhanced effective depth, HRM excels at tasks that demand extensive search and\nbacktracking. Using only 1,000 input-output examples, without pre-training or CoT supervi-\nsion, HRM learns to solve problems that are intractable for even the most advanced LLMs. For\nexample, it achieves near-perfect accuracy in complex Sudoku puzzles (Sudoku-Extreme Full) and\noptimal pathfinding in 30x30 mazes, where state-of-the-art CoT methods completely fail (0% ac-\ncuracy). In the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) AGI Challenge 27,28,29 - a benchmark\nof inductive reasoning - HRM, trained from scratch with only the official dataset (~1000 exam-\nples), with only 27M parameters and a 30x30 grid context (900 tokens), achieves a performance\nof 40.3%, which substantially surpasses leading CoT-based models like o3-mini-high (34.5%)\nand Claude 3.7 8K context (21.2%), despite their considerably larger parameter sizes and con-\ntext lengths, as shown in Figure 1. This represents a promising direction toward the development\nof next-generation AI reasoning systems with universal computational capabilities.\n2 Hierarchical Reasoning Model\nWe present the HRM, inspired by three fundamental principles of neural computation observed in\nthe brain:\n• Hierarchical processing: The brain processes information across a hierarchy of cortical ar-\neas.

This separation allows for stable, high-level guidance of rapid, low-level computa-\ntions32,33.\n• Recurrent Connectivity: The brain features extensive recurrent connections. These feedback\nloops enable iterative refinement, yielding more accurate and context-sensitive representations\nat the cost of additional processing time. Additionally, the brain largely avoids the problematic\ndeep credit assignment problem associated with BPTT19.\nThe HRM model consists of four learnable components: an input network fI(·; θI), a low-level re-\ncurrent module fL(·; θL), a high-level recurrent modulefH(·; θH), and an output networkfO(·; θO).\nThe model’s dynamics unfold over N high-level cycles of T low-level timesteps each2. We index\nthe total timesteps of one forward pass by i = 1, . . . , N× T. The modules fL and fH each keep a\nhidden state—zi\nL for fL and zi\nH for fH—which are initialized with the vectors z0\nL and z0\nH, respec-\ntively.\nThe HRM maps an input vector x to an output prediction vector ˆy as follows. First, the input x is\nprojected into a working representation ˜x by the input network:\n˜x = fI(x; θI) .\nAt each timestep i, the L-module updates its state conditioned on its own previous state, the H-\nmodule’s current state (which remains fixed throughout the cycle), and the input representation.\nThe H-module only updates once per cycle (i.e., every T timesteps) using the L-module’s final\nstate at the end of that cycle:\nzi\nL = fL\n\u0000\nzi−1\nL , zi−1\nH , ˜x; θL\n\u0001\n,\nzi\nH =\n(\nfH\n\u0000\nzi−1\nH , zi−1\nL ; θH\n\u0001\nif i ≡ 0 (mod T) ,\nzi−1\nH otherwise .\nFinally, after N full cycles, a prediction ˆy is extracted from the hidden state of the H-module:\nˆy = fO(zNT\nH ; θO) .\nThis entire NT -timestep process represents a single forward pass of the HRM. A halting mecha-\nnism (detailed later in this section) determines whether the model should terminate, in which case\nˆy will be used as the final prediction, or continue with an additional forward pass.\nHierarchical convergenceAlthough convergence is crucial for recurrent networks, standard RNNs\nare fundamentally limited by their tendency to converge too early. As the hidden state settles toward\na fixed point, update magnitudes shrink, effectively stalling subsequent computation and capping\nthe network’s effective depth. To preserve computational power, we actually want convergence to\nproceed very slowly–but engineering that gradual approach is difficult, since pushing convergence\ntoo far edges the system toward instability.\n2While inspired by temporal separation in the brain, our model’s “high-level” and “low-level” modules are concep-\ntual abstractions and do not map directly to specific neural oscillation frequencies.\n4"}

HRM shows hierarchical conver-\ngence: the H-module steadily converges, while the L-module repeatedly converges within cycles\nbefore being reset by H, resulting in residual spikes. The recurrent neural network exhibits rapid\nconvergence with residuals quickly approaching zero. In contrast, the deep neural network experi-\nences vanishing gradients, with significant residuals primarily in the initial (input) and final layers.\nHRM is explicitly designed to counteract this premature convergence through a process we term\nhierarchical convergence. During each cycle, the L-module (an RNN) exhibits stable convergence\nto a local equilibrium. This equilibrium, however, depends on the high-level state zH supplied\nduring that cycle. After completing the T steps, the H-module incorporates the sub-computation’s\noutcome (the final statezL) and performs its own update. ThiszH update establishes a fresh context\nfor the L-module, essentially “restarting” its computational path and initiating a new convergence\nphase toward a different local equilibrium.\nThis process allows the HRM to perform a sequence of distinct, stable, nested computations, where\nthe H-module directs the overall problem-solving strategy and the L-module executes the intensive\nsearch or refinement required for each step. Although a standard RNN may approach convergence\nwithin T iterations, the hierarchical convergence benefits from an enhanced effective depth of NT\nsteps. As empirically shown in Figure 3, this mechanism allows HRM both to maintain high\ncomputational activity (forward residual) over many steps (in contrast to a standard RNN, whose\nactivity rapidly decays) and to enjoy stable convergence. This translates into better performance at\nany computation depth, as illustrated in Figure 2.\nApproximate gradient Recurrent models typically use BPTT to compute gradients. However,\nBPTT requires storing the hidden states from the forward pass and then combining them with\ngradients during the backward pass, which demands O(T) memory for T timesteps. This heavy\nmemory burden forces smaller batch sizes and leads to poor GPU utilization, especially for large-\nscale networks. Additionally, because retaining the full history trace through time is biologically\nimplausible, it is unlikely that the brain implements BPTT19.\nFortunately, if a recurrent neural network converges to a fixed point, we can avoid unrolling its state\nsequence by applying backpropagation in a single step at that equilibrium point. Moreover, such a\nmechanism could plausibly be implemented in the brain using only local learning rules34,35. Based\n5"}

(3)\nBy substituting Equation (3) back into Equation (2), we arrive at the final simplified gradients.\nBefore defining our loss function, we must first introduce two key elements of our proposed\nmethod: deep supervision and adaptive computational time.\nDeep supervisionInspired by the principle that periodic neural oscillations regulate when learning\noccurs in the brain38, we incorporate a deep supervision mechanism into HRM, as detailed next.\nGiven a data sample (x, y), we run multiple forward passes of the HRM model, each of which we\nrefer to as a segment. Let M denote the total number of segments executed before termination.\nFor each segment m ∈ {1, . . . , M}, let zm = ( zmNT\nH , zmNT\nL ) represent the hidden state at the\nconclusion of segment m, encompassing both high-level and low-level state components.\nAt each segment m, we apply a deep supervision step as follows:\n1. Given the state zm−1 from the previous segment, compute the next statezm and its associated\noutput ˆym through a forward pass in the HRM model:\n(zm, ˆym) ← HRM(zm−1, x; θ)\n2. Compute the loss for the current segment:\nLm ← LOSS (ˆym, y)\n3. Update parameters:\nθ ← OPTIMIZER STEP (θ, ∇θLm)\nThe crucial aspect of this procedure is that the hidden state zm is “detached” from the computa-\ntion graph before being used as the input state for the next segment. Consequently, gradients from\nsegment m + 1 do not propagate back through segment m, effectively creating a 1-step approxi-\nmation of the gradient of the recursive deep supervision process39,40. This approach provides more\nfrequent feedback to the H-module and serves as a regularization mechanism, demonstrating supe-\nrior empirical performance and enhanced stability in deep equilibrium models when compared to\nmore complex, Jacobian-based regularization techniques 39,41. Figure 4 shows pseudocode of deep\nsupervision training.\nAdaptive computational time (ACT)The brain dynamically alternates between automatic think-\ning (“System 1”) and deliberate reasoning (“System 2”) 42. Neuroscientific evidence shows that\nthese cognitive modes share overlapping neural circuits, particularly within regions such as the\nprefrontal cortex and the default mode network43,44. This indicates that the brain dynamically mod-\nulates the “runtime” of these circuits according to task complexity and potential rewards45,46.\nInspired by the above mechanism, we incorporate an adaptive halting strategy into HRM that en-\nables “thinking, fast and slow”. This integration leverages deep supervision and uses the Q-learning\n7"}

A Q-head uses the final state of the\nH-module to predict the Q-values ˆQm = ( ˆQm\nhalt, ˆQm\ncontinue) of the “halt” and “continue” actions:\nˆQm = σ(θ⊤\nQzmNT\nH ) ,\nwhere σ denotes the sigmoid function applied element-wise. The halt or continue action is chosen\nusing a randomized strategy as detailed next. Let Mmax denote the maximum number of segments\n(a fixed hyperparameter) and Mmin denote the minimum number of segments (a random variable).\nThe value ofMmin is determined stochastically: with probabilityε, it is sampled uniformly from the\nset {2, ··· , Mmax} (to encourage longer thinking), and with probability1−ε, it is set to 1. The halt\naction is selected under two conditions: when the segment count surpasses the maximum threshold\nMmax, or when the estimated halt value ˆQhalt exceeds the estimated continue value ˆQcontinue and the\nsegment count has reached at least the minimum threshold Mmin.\nThe Q-head is updated through a Q-learning algorithm, which is defined on the following episodic\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP). The state of the MDP at segment m is zm, and the action space\nis {halt, continue}. Choosing the action “halt” terminates the episode and returns a binary reward\nindicating prediction correctness, i.e., 1{ˆym = y}. Choosing “continue” yields a reward of 0 and\nthe state transitions to zm+1. Thus, the Q-learning targets for the two actions ˆGm = ( ˆGm\nhalt, ˆGm\ncontinue)\nare given by\nˆGm\nhalt = 1{ˆym = y},\nˆGm\ncontinue =\n\n\n\nˆQm+1\nhalt , if m ≥ Nmax ,\nmax( ˆQm+1\nhalt , ˆQm+1\ncontinue) , otherwise .\nWe can now define the loss function of our learning procedure. The overall loss for each supervision\nsegment combines both the Q-head loss and the sequence-to-sequence loss:\nLm\nACT = LOSS (ˆym, y) + BINARY CROSS ENTROPY ( ˆQm, ˆGm) .\nMinimizing the above loss enables both accurate predictions and nearly optimal stopping decisions.\nSelecting the “halt” action ends the supervision loop. In practice, sequences are processed in\nbatches, which can be easily handled by substituting any halted sample in the batch with a fresh\nsample from the dataloader.\nFigure 5 presents a performance comparison between two HRM variants: one incorporating ACT\nand another employing a fixed computational step count equivalent to ACT’s Mmax parameter. It\nshows that ACT effectively adapts its computational resources based on task complexity, achieving\nsignificant computational savings with minimal impact on performance.\nInference-time scaling An effective neural model should exploit additional computational re-\nsources during inference to enhance performance. As illustrated in Figure 5-(c), HRM seamlessly\nachieves inference-time scaling by simply increasing the computational limit parameter, Mmax\nwithout requiring further training or architectural modifications.\nAdditional compute is especially effective for tasks that demand deeper reasoning. On Sudoku—\na problem that often requires long-term planning—HRM exhibits strong inference-time scaling.\nOn the other hand, we find that extra computational resources yield minimal gains in ARC-AGI\nchallenge, as solutions generally require only a few transformations.\n8"}

Models trained with a specific Mmax can generalize to higher compu-\ntational limits during inference, leading to improved accuracy. For example, a model trained with\nMmax = 8 continues to see accuracy gains when run with Mmax = 16 during inference.\nStability of Q-learning in ACTThe deep Q-learning that underpins our ACT mechanism is\nknown to be prone to instability, often requiring stabilization techniques such as replay buffers\nand target networks 48, which are absent in our design. Our approach, however, achieves stability\nthrough the intrinsic properties of our model and training procedure. Recent theoretical work by\nGallici et al.49 shows that Q-learning can achieve convergence if network parameters are bounded,\nweight decay is incorporated during training, and post-normalization layers are implemented. Our\nmodel satisfies these conditions through its Post-Norm architecture that employs RMSNorm (a\nlayer normalization variant) and the AdamW optimizer. AdamW has been shown to solve an L∞-\nconstrained optimization problem, ensuring that model parameters remain bounded by 1/λ50.\nArchitectural details We employ a sequence-to-sequence architecture for HRM. Both input and\noutput are represented as token sequences: x = ( x1, . . . , xl) and y = ( y1, . . . , yl′) respectively.\nThe model includes an embedding layer fI that converts discrete tokens into vector representa-\ntions, and an output head fO(z; θO) = softmax(θOz) that transforms hidden states into token prob-\nability distributions ˆy. For small-sample experiments, we replace softmax with stablemax 51 to\nimprove generalization performance. The sequence-to-sequence loss is averaged over all tokens,\nLOSS (ˆy, y) = 1\nl′\nPl′\ni=1 log p(yi), where p(yi) is the probability that distribution ˆyi assigns to token\nyi. The initial hidden states z0 are initialized by sampling from a truncated normal distribution with\nstandard deviation of 1, truncation of 2, and kept fixed throughout training.\nBoth the low-level and high-level recurrent modules fL and fH are implemented using encoder-\nonly Transformer52 blocks with identical architectures and dimensions. These modules take mul-\ntiple inputs, and we use straightforward element-wise addition to combine them, though more\nsophisticated merging techniques such as gating mechanisms could potentially improve perfor-\nmance and is left for future work. For all Transformer blocks in this work—including those in\nthe baseline models—we incorporate the enhancements found in modern LLMs (based on Llama53\narchitectures). These improvements include Rotary Positional Encoding 54, Gated Linear Units 55,\nRMSNorm56, and the removal of bias terms from linear layers.\nFurthermore, both HRM and recurrent Transformer models implement a Post-Norm architecture\n9"}

Figure 6-(a,b,c) presents a visual representa-\ntion of the three benchmark tasks, which are selected to evaluate various reasoning abilities in AI\nmodels.\n3.1 Benchmarks\nARC-AGI Challenge The ARC-AGI benchmark evaluates general fluid intelligence through IQ-\ntest-like puzzles that require inductive reasoning27. The initial version, ARC-AGI-1, presents chal-\nlenges as input-label grid pairs that force AI systems to extract and generalize abstract rules from\njust a few examples. Each task provides a few input–output demonstration pairs (usually 2–3) and\na test input. An AI model has two attempts to produce the correct output grid. Although some be-\nlieve that mastering ARC-AGI would signal true artificial general intelligence, its primary purpose\nis to expose the current roadblocks in AGI progress. In fact, both conventional deep learning meth-\nods and CoT techniques have faced significant challenges with ARC-AGI-1, primarily because it\nrequires the ability to generalize to entirely new tasks28.\nAddressing the limitations identified in ARC-AGI-1, ARC-AGI-2 significantly expands the bench-\nmark by providing a more comprehensive and carefully refined collection of tasks. These new\ntasks emphasize deeper compositional reasoning, multi-step logic, contextual rule application, and\nsymbolic abstraction. Human calibration studies show these tasks are challenging but doable for\npeople, while being much harder for current AI systems, offering a clearer measure of general\nreasoning abilities29.\n10"}

A prediction is considered correct if it exactly matches the\npuzzle’s unique solution. Sudoku’s complex logical structure makes it a popular benchmark for\nevaluating logical reasoning in machine learning62,63,64.\nThe most frequently used Sudoku dataset in research, namely the Kaggle dataset 65, can be fully\nsolved using elementary single-digit techniques66. The minimal 17-clue puzzles62, another widely-\nused collection, might seem more challenging due to its small number of clues. However, this\nperception is misleading—since 17 represents the minimum number of clues required to guarantee\na unique Sudoku solution, these hints need to be highly orthogonal to each other. This orthogonal\narrangement leads to many direct, easily-resolved solution paths67.\nWe introduce Sudoku-Extreme, a more challenging dataset that is compiled from the aforemen-\ntioned easy datasets as well as puzzles recognized by the Sudoku community as exceptionally\ndifficult for human players:\n• Easy puzzles compiled from Kaggle, 17-clue, plus unbiased samples from the Sudoku puzzle\ndistribution67: totaling 1 149 158puzzles.\n• Challenging puzzles compiled from Magictour 1465, Forum-Hard and Forum-Extreme subsets:\ntotaling 3 104 157puzzles.\nThe compiled data then undergo a strict 90/10 train-test split, ensuring that the test set puzzles\ncannot be derived through equivalent transformations of any training samples. Sudoku-Extreme is\na down-sampled subset of this data containing 1000 training examples. We use Sudoku-Extreme in\nour main experiments (Figure 1), which focuses on small-sample learning scenarios. To guarantee\nconvergence and control overfitting effects in our analysis experiments (Figures 2, 3 and 5), we use\nthe complete training data, Sudoku-Extreme-Full, containing 3 831 994examples.\nWe measure puzzle difficulty by counting the number of search backtracks (“guesses”) required\nby a smart Sudoku solver program tdoku, which uses propositional logic to reduce the number of\nguesses67. Our Sudoku-Extreme dataset exhibits a mean difficulty of 22 backtracks per puzzle, sig-\nnificantly higher than existing datasets, including recent handmade puzzles Sudoku-Bench68 which\naverage just 0.45 backtracks per puzzle. These subset complexity levels are shown in Figure 6-(d).\nMaze-Hard This task involves finding the optimal path in a 30 ×30 maze, making it interpretable\nand frequently used for training LLMs in search tasks 69,70,71. We adopt the instance generation\nprocedure of Lehnert et al.71, but introduce an additional filter to retain only those instances whose\ndifficulty exceeds 110. Here, “difficulty” is defined as the length of the shortest path, which aligns\nwith the linear time complexity of the wavefront breadth-first search algorithm on GPUs72. A path\nis considered correct if it is valid and optimal—that is, the shortest route from the start to the goal.\nThe training and test set both include 1000 examples.\n3.2 Evaluation Details\nFor all benchmarks, HRM models were initialized with random weights and trained in the sequence-\nto-sequence setup using the input-output pairs. The two-dimensional input and output grids were\nflattened and then padded to the maximum sequence length. The resulting performance is shown in\nFigure 1. Remarkably, HRM attains these results with just ~1000 training examples per task—and\nwithout pretraining or CoT labels.\n11"}

Interestingly, on\nARC-AGI-1, “Direct pred” matches the performance of Liao and Gu 73 , who built a carefully de-\nsigned, domain-specific equivariant network for learning the ARC-AGI task from scratch, without\npre-training. By substituting the Transformer architecture with HRM’s hierarchical framework and\nimplementing ACT, we achieve more than a twofold performance improvement.\nOn the Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard benchmarks, the performance gap between HRM and the\nbaseline methods is significant, as the baselines almost never manage to solve the tasks. These\nbenchmarks that demand lengthy reasoning traces are particularly difficult for CoT-based methods.\nWith only 1000 training examples, the “Direct pred” baseline—which employs an 8-layer Trans-\nformer identical in size to HRM—fails entirely on these challenging reasoning problems. When\ntrained on the larger Sudoku-Extreme-Full dataset, however, “Direct pred” can solve some easy\nSudoku puzzles and reaches 16.9% accuracy (see Figure 2). Lehnert et al. 71 showed that a large\nvanilla Transformer model with 175M parameters, trained on 1 million examples across multiple\ntrials, achieved only marginal success on 30x30 Maze tasks, with accuracy below 20% using the\npass@64 evaluation metric.\n3.3 Visualization of intermediate timesteps\nAlthough HRM demonstrates strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, it raises an intrigu-\ning question: what underlying reasoning algorithms does the HRM neural network actually imple-\nment? Addressing this question is important for enhancing model interpretability and developing a\ndeeper understanding of the HRM solution space.\nWhile a definitive answer lies beyond our current scope, we begin our investigation by analyzing\nstate trajectories and their corresponding solution evolution. More specifically, at each timestep\ni and given the low-level and high-level state pair ( zi\nL and zi\nH) we perform a preliminary forward\npass through the H-module to obtain¯zi = fH(zi\nH, zi\nL; θH) and its corresponding decoded prediction\n¯yi = fO(¯zi; θO). The prediction ¯yi is then visualized in Figure 7.\nIn the Maze task, HRM appears to initially explore several potential paths simultaneously, subse-\nquently eliminating blocked or inefficient routes, then constructing a preliminary solution outline\n3The ARC-AGI allows two attempts for each test input.\n12"}

Higher-order cortical areas, responsible for complex reasoning and decision-making,\nmust handle a wide variety of tasks, demanding more flexible and context-dependent processing77.\nIn dynamical systems, this flexibility is often realized through higher-dimensional state-space tra-\njectories, which allow for a richer repertoire of potential computations 78. This principle gives rise\nto an observable dimensionality hierarchy, where a region’s position in the processing hierarchy\n13"}

To quantify this phenomenon, we can examine the\nParticipation Ratio (PR), which serves as a standard measure of the effective dimensionality of a\nhigh-dimensional representation79. The PR is calculated using the formula\nPR = (P\ni λi)2\nP\ni λ2\ni\n,\nwhere {λi} are the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of neural trajectories. Intuitively, a higher\nPR value signifies that variance is distributed more evenly across many dimensions, corresponding\nto a higher-dimensional representation. Conversely, a lower PR value indicates that variance is\nconcentrated in only a few principal components, reflecting a more compact, lower-dimensional\nstructure.\nThe dimensionality hierarchy can be observed, for example, in the mouse cortex, where the PR of\npopulation activity increases monotonically from low-level sensory areas to high-level associative\nareas, supporting this link between dimensionality and functional complexity74 (Figure 8 (a,b)).\nWe evaluated whether HRM reproduces this neuroscientific principle by calculating the PR for\nboth recurrent modules after training on the Sudoku-Extreme Full dataset. The PR computation\nused the covariance matrix derived from neural states gathered across multiple Sudoku-solving\ntrajectories. The results show a striking parallel to the biological findings. The low-level module’s\nstate (zL) occupies a relatively small subspace with a participation ratio of 30.22, whereas the high-\nlevel module’s state ( zH) operates in a substantially larger subspace with a participation ratio of\n89.95, as shown in Figure 8(c). Furthermore, Figure 8(d) shows that increasing the number of\nunique tasks (trajectories) from 10 to 100 causes zH dimensionality to scale up accordingly, while\nzL dimensionality remains stable. These results suggest an emergent separation of representational\ncapacity between the modules that parallels their functional roles.\nTo confirm that this hierarchical organization is an emergent property of training, and not an artifact\nof the network’s architecture, we performed a control analysis using an identical but untrained\nnetwork with random weights.\nWe initialized an identical HRM architecture with random weights and, without any training, mea-\nsured the PR of its modules as the network processed the same task-specific inputs given to the\ntrained model.\nThe results, shown in Figure 8(e,f), reveal a stark contrast: the high-level and low-level modules of\nthe untrained network exhibit no hierarchical separation, with their PR values remaining low and\nnearly indistinguishable from each other. This control analysis validates that the dimensionality\nhierarchy is an emergent property that arises as the model learns to perform complex reasoning.\nThe high-to-low PR ratio in HRM ( zH/zL ≈ 2.98) closely matches that measured in the mouse\ncortex (≈ 2.25). In contrast, conventional deep networks often exhibit neural collapse, where\nlast-layer features converge to a low-dimensional subspace80,81,82. HRM therefore departs from the\ncollapse pattern and instead fosters a high-dimensional representation in its higher module. This\nis significant because such representations are considered crucial for cognitive flexibility and are a\nhallmark of higher-order brain regions like the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is central to complex\nreasoning.\nThis structural parallel suggests the model has discovered a fundamental organizational principle.\nBy learning to partition its representations into a high-capacity, high-dimensional subspace ( zH)\n15"}

This line of work includes Neural Turing Machines (NTM) 83,\nthe Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) 84, and Neural GPUs 85–all of which construct iterative\nneural architectures that mimic computational hardware for algorithm execution, and are trained to\nlearn algorithms from data. Another notable work in this area is Recurrent Relational Networks\n(RRN)62, which executes algorithms on graph representations through graph neural networks.\nRecent studies have integrated algorithm learning approaches with Transformer-based architec-\ntures. Universal Transformers extend the standard Transformer model by introducing a recurrent\nloop over the layers and implementing an adaptive halting mechanism. Geiping et al.86 demonstrate\nthat looped Transformers can generalize to a larger number of recurrent steps during inference than\nwhat they were trained on. Shen et al. 16 propose adding continuous recurrent reasoning tokens\nto the Transformer. Finally, TransNAR 8 combine recurrent graph neural networks with language\nmodels.\nBuilding on the success of CoT-based reasoning, a line of work have introduced fine-tuning meth-\nods that use reasoning paths from search algorithms (like A*) as SFT targets87,71,70.\nWe also mention adaptive halting mechanisms designed to allocate additional computational re-\nsources to more challenging problems. This includes the Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) for\nRNNs88 and follow-up research like PonderNet89, which aims to improve the stability of this allo-\ncation process.\nHRM further pushes the boundary of algorithm learning through a brain-inspired computational\narchitecture that achieves exceptional data efficiency and model expressiveness, successfully dis-\ncovering complex and diverse algorithms from just 1000 training examples.\nBrain-inspired reasoning architecturesDeveloping a model with the reasoning power of the\nbrain has long been a goal in brain-inspired computing. Spaun90 is one notable example, which uses\nspiking neural networks to create distinct modules corresponding to brain regions like the visual\ncortex and prefrontal cortex. This design enables an architecture to perform a range of cognitive\ntasks, from memory recall to simple reasoning puzzles. However, its reasoning relies on hand-\ndesigned algorithms, which may limit its ability to learn new tasks. Another significant model is the\nTolman-Eichenbaum Machine (TEM)91, which is inspired by the hippocampal-entorhinal system’s\nrole in spatial and relational memory tasks.

Another approach involves neural sampling models92, which view the neural signaling\nprocess as inference over a distribution, functioning similarly to a Boltzmann machine. These\nmodels often require hand-made rules to be set up for solving a specific reasoning task. In essence,\nwhile prior models are restricted to simple reasoning problems, HRM is designed to solve complex\ntasks that are hard for even advanced LLMs, without pre-training or task-specific manual design.\nHierarchical memory The hierarchical multi-timescale structure also plays an important role in\nhow the brain processes memory. Models such as Hierarchical Sequential Models93 and Clockwork\nRNN94 use multiple recurrent modules that operate at varying time scales to more effectively cap-\nture long-range dependencies within sequences, thereby mitigating the forgetting issue in RNNs.\nSimilar mechanisms have also been adopted in linear attention methods for memorizing long con-\ntexts (see the Discussions section). Since HRM focuses on reasoning, full attention is applied for\nsimplicity. Incorporating hierarchical memory into HRM could be a promising future direction.\n6 Discussions\nTuring-completeness of HRMLike earlier neural reasoning algorithms including the Universal\nTransformer95, HRM is computationally universal when given sufficient memory and time con-\nstraints. In other words, it falls into the category of models that can simulate any Turing machine,\novercoming the computational limitations of standard Transformers discussed previously in the in-\ntroduction. Given that earlier neural algorithm reasoners were trained as recurrent neural networks,\nthey suffer from premature convergence and memory intensive BPTT. Therefore, in practice, their\neffective computational depth remains limited, though still deeper than that of a standard Trans-\nformer. By resolving these two challenges and being equipped with adaptive computation, HRM\ncould be trained on long reasoning processes, solve complex puzzles requiring intensive depth-first\nsearch and backtracking, and move closer to practical Turing-completeness.\nReinforcement learning with chain-of-thoughtBeyond fine-tuning using human-annotated CoT,\nreinforcement learning (RL) represents another widely adopted training methodology. However,\nrecent evidence suggests that RL primarily unlocks existing CoT-like capabilities rather than dis-\ncovering fundamentally new reasoning mechanisms 96,97,98,99. Additionally, CoT-training with RL\nis known for its instability and data inefficiency, often requiring extensive exploration and careful\nreward design. In contrast, HRM takes feedback from dense gradient-based supervision rather than\nrelying on a sparse reward signal. Moreover, HRM operates naturally in a continuous space, which\nis biologically plausible and avoids allocating same computational resources to each token, even\nthough tokens vary in their reasoning and planning complexity16.\nLinear attention Recurrence has been explored not only for its capability in universal computa-\ntion, but also as a means to replace the attention mechanism in Transformers, which suffers from\nquadratic time and memory complexity 100. Recurrent alternatives offer a more efficient design by\nprocessing input tokens sequentially and predicting the next token at each time step, similar to early\nRNN-based language models.\nSome linear-attention variants, such as Log-linear Attention101, share an RNN-like state-update that\ncan be interpreted as propagating multi-timescale summary statistics, thereby retaining long-range\ncontext without the quadratic memory growth of standard self-attention. However, substituting the\nattention mechanism alone does not change the fact that Transformers are still fixed-depth, and\n17"}

With only 27M parameters and train-\ning on just 1000 examples, HRM effectively solves challenging reasoning problems such as ARC,\nSudoku, and complex maze navigation–tasks that typically pose significant difficulties for contem-\nporary LLM and chain-of-thought models.\nAlthough the brain relies heavily on hierarchical structures to enable most cognitive processes,\nthese concepts have largely remained confined to academic literature rather than being translated\ninto practical applications. The prevailing AI approach continues to favor non-hierarchical models.\nOur results challenge this established paradigm and suggest that the Hierarchical Reasoning Model\nrepresents a viable alternative to the currently dominant chain-of-thought reasoning methods, ad-\nvancing toward a foundational framework capable of Turing-complete universal computation.\nAcknowledgements We thank Mingli Yuan, Ahmed Murtadha Hasan Mahyoub and Hengshuai\nYao for their insightful discussions and valuable feedback throughout the course of this work.\n18"}

This original Web was fundamentally about connection, link-\ning users to content, services, and one another.\nThe emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a\npivotal shift toward theAgentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by au-\ntonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact directly with\none another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on behalf of users. This\ntransition from human-driven to machine-to-machine interaction allows intent to\nbe delegated, relieving users from routine digital operations and enabling a more\ninteractive, automated web experience.\nIn this paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building\nthe Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and\nidentify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to our\nframework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions: intelligence,\ninteraction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable the capabilities of\nAI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and collaboration.\nWe analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges involved in creating scal-\nable agentic systems, including communication protocols, orchestration strategies,\nand emerging paradigms such as the Agent Attention Economy. We conclude by\ndiscussing the potential applications, societal risks, and governance issues posed by\nagentic systems, and outline research directions for developing open, secure, and in-\ntelligent ecosystems shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior.\nA continuously updated collection of relevant studies for agentic web is available at:\nhttps://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/agentic-web.\nKeywords: Agentic Web, LLM Agents, Web Architecture, Safety & Security\n∗S.

In its early phases, the Web enabled hu-\nman–machine interaction for tasks that were informational (e.g., reading news), transactional (e.g.,\nonline shopping), or communicational (e.g., messaging and email). Intelligence in this era resided in\nthe tools that helped users access, filter, and interact with content: search engines (Brin and Page,\n1998), recommender systems (Wang et al., 2006; Koren et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2013; Zhang et al.,\n2013), and user interfaces (Deaton, 2003). However, the user was always the active party, manually\nnavigating between pages, initiating actions, and making decisions at every step.\nFor the last few years, a shift has been taking place: the emergence of AI agents powered by large\nlanguage models (LLMs) (Yang et al., 2023a; Kapoor et al., 2024). TheseAI agents are software\nentities capable of perceiving their environment, reasoning, and taking actions autonomously to\nachieve goals set by the user. With the integration of perception and execution components, LLMs\nare no longer limited to responding to prompts: they can act through agents that plan, remember,\nand interact across digital systems (Wang et al., 2023). Importantly, these agents are not constrained\nto single-turn interactions but can carry out complex, long-horizon tasks. Moreover, multiple agents\ncan be orchestrated to work collaboratively on sophisticated objectives (Qian et al., 2024; Yang\net al., 2025e; Gottweis et al., 2025; Sapkota et al., 2025).\nThe transformation toward agent-based systems is driven by two powerful forces. First, AI assistants\nare becoming increasingly capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks across domains such as\nresearch (Ren et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025b; Schmidgall et al., 2025), software development (Hong\net al., 2023; Xia et al., 2024), customer support (Rome et al., 2024), and personal productivity (Li\netal.,2024b). Theseagentsarenolongerreactivetoolsrespondingtoisolatedprompts, butproactive\ncollaborators that plan, reason, and execute actions over time. Second, users are becoming more\ncomfortabledelegatingnotjustindividualqueriesbutentireworkflows(sometimesspanningminutes,\nhours, or even days) to such agents (Guo et al., 2024; Hong et al., 2024). This growing trust in agent\nautonomy introduces new expectations and necessitates new interfaces, leading to a fundamental\nshift in how the Web is used and experienced.\nThis evolution lays the foundation for what we formally define as theAgentic Web. In this emerging\nparadigm, the Web is no longer merely a platform for human interaction with content and services,\nbut a dynamic environment in which autonomous agents act, communicate, and collaborate across\nservices and domains on behalf of their users (Petrova et al., 2025; Lù et al., 2025; Chaffer, 2025).\nFor instance, the ChatGPT Agent released in July 2025 enables AI agents to act on behalf of users\nby performing tasks such as planning and purchasing ingredients for a Japanese breakfast or booking\nreservations (OpenAI, 2025).\nDefinition: Agentic Web\nThe Agentic Web is a distributed, interactive internet ecosystem in which autonomous\nsoftware agents, often powered by large language models, act as autonomous intermediaries\nthat persistently plan, coordinate, and execute goal-directed tasks. In this paradigm, web\nresources and services are agent-accessible, enabling continuous agent-to-agent interaction,\ndynamic information exchange, and value creation alongside traditional human-web interac-\ntions.\nUnlike the traditional Web, which serves primarily to connect documents, services, and users for\ninformational, transactional, and communicational purposes, the Agentic Web enables intelligent,\ngoal-directedinteraction.

IntheAgenticWeb, the end usersremainhuman, whilethe mid users(those\nwho actively navigate, process, generate content, and interact with the environment) are AI agents.\nThese agents interpret and carry out user intent by interacting with a distributed network of other\nagents and services.\nA user query is no longer a simple request for isolated information, but a delegation of a complex\ntask, which may involve negotiation, planning, and adaptation over multiple steps. With the support\nof structured or open-ended communication protocols (Yang et al., 2025d), these agents collaborate\nacross domains to complete workflows and deliver results that reflect high-level user goals (Lin et al.,\n2024b; Yang et al., 2025c). This agent-mediated process is illustrated in Figure 1, which depicts a\ntypical task lifecycle from user intent to multi-agent execution and result delivery.\nIn this new paradigm, webpages evolve into active software agents, characterised not just by their\nstatic content but by their capabilities, interfaces, and roles within broader task structures. Hy-\nperlinks, which once represented passive navigational paths, now act as coordination channels that\nfacilitate inter-agent communication, dynamic task decomposition, and cooperative execution. The\nAgentic Web, therefore, transforms the Web from a network of linked documents into an ecosystem\nof interactive, intelligent agents.\nBeyond changes in interaction models, the Agentic Web also redefines how information is stored,\nlinked, and transmitted. In the early Personal Computer (PC) era, web content was mostly in-\nstitutionally produced, with relatively small data volumes that users accessed primarily through\nkeyword search. As the mobile internet expanded, User-Generated Content (UGC) exploded, in-\ncreasing the scale and diversity of information. This shift raised the cost of search and gave rise to\nrecommendation systems as the dominant paradigm for matching information supply and demand.\nWith the emergence of LLMs and agentic systems, the underlying logic of information flows under-\ngoes another major transformation.

Moreover, agents can\nexecute transactions and complete consumption processes on behalf of users, introducing a new\nproduction–consumption dynamic in which information and services may be created primarily for\nagents rather than humans. In some cases, web content may not be authored directly by humans\nat all but generated by agents in real time, leading to an ecosystem where agents both produce and\nconsume knowledge.\nExample (Transactional)\nIn the Traditional Web, a transactional task such as booking a flight is manually performed\nby the user. The process typically involves visiting travel websites, entering search queries,\nadjusting filters, comparing ticket options across multiple tabs or platforms, and finalising the\nbooking decision. While the Web may offer assistance through features such as recommendation\nengines, user interfaces, and search algorithms, the task execution remains user-driven and\nrequires active, step-by-step involvement.\nIn the Agentic Web, the same task is initiated through high-level intent delegation. The user\nprovides a goal-oriented instruction (e.g., “Book a flight to New York next weekend within my\nbudget”), andanautonomousagentcarriesoutthetaskontheirbehalf. Theagentautonomously\ninteracts with services and APIs, queries and parses webpages, refines options based on user\npreferences, and completes the booking. It may perform multiple iterations and coordinate with\nother agents, requiring no further user intervention.\nThe above example illustrates the core distinction: the Traditional Web is defined by human-led\ninteraction over static services, while the Agentic Web enables persistent, intelligent, machine-led\nworkflows that extend across multiple services and interactions. Figure 2 complements this distinc-\ntion by visualizing how user-system interactions have evolved from passive consumption to active\nagent delegation across three Web eras.\nExample (Informational)\nIn theTraditional Web, an informational task such as understanding how different large language\nmodels process multimodal inputs requires the user to manually locate whitepapers, extract ar-\nchitecture diagrams, search for benchmark results, and assemble the findings into a report. This\ninvolves switching between academic search engines, blog posts, PDF viewers, and spreadsheet\ntools.\nIn the Agentic Web, the same task is delegated to a Deep Research agent (e.g., “Produce a\nreport comparing how GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude handle text and image inputs, including\ntables and flowcharts”). The agent interprets the query and plans a multi-stage workflow. It\nretrieves content from online sources and technical repositories via API calls, browser access,\nand the Model Context Protocol (MCP) (Anthropic, 2024b), which enables standardized access\nto external tools and structured resources. The agent then parses PDF and HTML documents,\ninvokes specialized modules for table extraction, diagram generation, and result visualization,\nand integrates the outputs into a structured report through multi-step reasoning.\nThis example illustrates how the Agentic Web extends beyond static content retrieval to complex,\nadaptive information processing.\nAs a result, foundational Web concepts such as PageRank (Page et al., 1999), along with broader\nsystems including web search (Broder, 2002), recommender systems (Resnick and Varian, 1997),\nand computational advertising models (Nelson, 1974), must be reinterpreted.

This progression is\nvisualized in Figure 3, which presents a high-level timeline of the Web’s evolution across technological\nparadigms and business models.\nEach era is characterised by significant shifts in technological paradigms, commercial models, and\nuser behavior patterns. The PC Web Erawas centred around information directories and search\nparadigms, with content organized through static web pages that users manually browsed to locate\ndesired information. Search engines emerged to support efficient retrieval, and keyword-based ad-\nvertising systems marked the beginning of the commercial Web. The subsequentMobile Web Era\nintroduced a fundamental shift toward recommendation-driven content consumption, where algorith-\nmic curation became essential due to the explosion of user-generated content and mobile platform\nconstraints. Today, the Web is entering theAgentic Web Era, propelled by breakthroughs in foun-\ndation models and agent-based paradigms, where intelligent agents coordinate complex tasks and\nreshape both technical architecture and commercial logic. Figure 4 illustrates how user attention\nflows have evolved across these Web eras, from linear search and ad delivery models, to algorithmic\nfeed curation, and finally to agent-mediated task execution involving multiple competing services.\n2.1 PC Web Era\nThe PC Web Era represents the foundational stage of the Internet’s evolution, marked by static\ncontent delivery and goal-oriented information retrieval. During this period, the user experience\nwas shaped by limited interactivity, minimal personalization, and the early commercialization of the\nweb through keyword-based search and advertising systems.\n2.1.1 Static Pages and Search-based Commercial Marketing\nThe PC Web was dominated by aretrieval paradigmcharacterized by users relying on active queries\nand manual browsing to access information in an era of rapidly expanding digital content. At this\nstage, the Web lacked intelligent mechanisms for information dispensing. The content was primarily\npresented through static web pages with fixed organizational structures, with limited interactivity\nand personalised recommendations. Web platforms like Yellow Pages and Craigslist relied heavily\non manual categorization and predefined navigation to link various types of information. These\nwebsites were typically organized by geography, industry, or service type, mirroring the taxonomy\nof printed directories and classified ads to present business listings, personal posts, and product\ninformation.\nFrom the perspective of users, this retrieval paradigm required a strong sense of goal-directed be-\nhavior. The information-seeking process was linear and static, requiring users to have a clear goal\nfor their search and to invest time and effort in locating the information they needed by navigat-\ning through hierarchical directories. This simple but inefficient paradigm struggled to meet users’\nincreasing demand for speed, relevance, and personalization.\nAs the scale of the Web expanded rapidly, the conventional directory-based paradigm proved inad-\nequate to satisfy the growing demand for efficient information retrieval. To address this challenge,\nsearch engines emerged and became a critical turning point in the evolution of the Web. Early\nsystems relied on basic keyword matching techniques like TF-IDF (Sparck Jones, 1988), which mea-\nsured term frequency but struggled with document authority and relevance ranking. Building upon\nTF-IDF, more sophisticated probabilistic models such as BM25 (Robertson et al., 2009) were devel-\noped to address issues like document length normalization and term frequency saturation, providing\nbetter text relevance scoring mechanisms. Meanwhile, Latent Semantic Indexing (Deerwester et al.,"}

The three eras of web evolution are not strictly distinct. Their\ntransitions happened gradually, with technologies, features, and business models often overlapping\nand coexisting across different periods.\nA significant milestone was the PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1999), which pioneered the con-\ncept of “link-based voting” by evaluating the importance and authority of web pages through their\nhyperlink structures. In comparison with earlier methods that relied solely on keyword match-\ning, PageRank significantly enhanced the relevance of search results, laid the foundation for search\nengines like Google, and greatly increased user reliance on search engines.\nSubsequent to this technological breakthrough, search engines integrated advertising mechanisms\nbased on user intent. Early search advertising systems, such as Google AdWords, matched user\nqueries with commercial content through sophisticated auction algorithms. The evolution from sim-\nple “pay-your-bid” mechanisms used by early systems like Overture to more sophisticated auction\ntheories became crucial. Google AdWords implemented the Generalized Second-Price auction al-\ngorithm (Edelman et al., 2007), where advertisers bid for keyword placement but pay the price of\nthe next-highest bidder, creating more stable and efficient bidding behavior than earlier first-price\nauction systems.\nThe introduction of Quality Score further refined this mechanism by balancing bid amounts with\nad relevance, rewarding high-quality advertisements with better positions and lower costs. This\nkeyword-driven, pay-per-click (PPC) model enhanced ad conversion rates whilst providing sustain-\nable revenue streams for search engines, establishing a direct link between web content and com-\nmercial marketing and ultimately initiating the commercialization of the Web based on search.\n2.2 Mobile Web Era\nThe transition to the Mobile Web Era was driven by fundamental changes in the Web’s information\nlandscape that extended beyond the mere adoption of mobile devices.\nThe most significant driver was the explosive growth in content volume during the late PC Web\nera. User-Generated Content proliferated across social platforms, e-commerce sites, and streaming\nservices, creating massive data flows that traditional search paradigms struggled to navigate effec-\ntively. Users found themselves overwhelmed by choice and increasingly unable to discover relevant\ncontent through manual search alone.\nThis content explosion coincided with a shift in user behavior from intent-driven to discovery-driven\nconsumption. Rather than approaching the Web with specific queries, users increasingly sought\nserendipitous discovery and personalized exploration. Mobile contexts amplified this trend, as users\nconsumed content in shorter, fragmented sessions while expecting instant, personalized experiences\nwithout active searching.\nRecommender Systems, which had already existed during the PC Web era for specific use cases,\nthus evolved from auxiliary tools to central architectural components. Mobile platforms introduced\ndistinct design challenges such as latency constraints, limited screen space, and fragmented user at-\ntention. These challenges catalyzed advancements in recommender system architectures, promoting\nthe development of real-time, context-aware models tailored to mobile interaction patterns.\n9"}

Dashed arrows\nin the agentic stage indicate competitive or compositional relationships between services.\n2.2.1 Recommender Systems\nThe progression of Recommender Systems mirrors the broader technological transitions across web\nplatforms. In the early era of the PC Web, Recommender Systems primarily relied on collaborative\nfiltering techniques to provide personalized suggestions based on historical user-item interactions.\nUser-based and item-based k-nearest neighbor models were widely adopted due to their simplicity\nand interpretability (Sarwar et al., 2001), while matrix factorization approaches became mainstream\nfor uncovering latent preferences and item attributes. Although foundational, these methods suffered\nfrom scalability and sparsity challenges, especially as web content and user bases expanded rapidly.\nEarly solutions like Singular Value Decomposition in latent factor models (Koren et al., 2009) were\ninstrumentalinestablishingthecoretechnicalunderpinningsofmodernrecommendersystems. How-\never, their static nature and inability to model complex behavior made them increasingly inadequate\nin dynamic environments. A critical bridge between traditional methods and modern deep learning\nwas established through Factorization Machines (Rendle, 2010), which modeled feature interactions\nthrough factorized parameters and enabled efficient computation with sparse data. This approach\naddressed the limitation of traditional matrix factorization in handling diverse feature types and\nbecame a foundation for subsequent hybrid architectures.\nAs user interaction became more real-time and context-rich in the Mobile Web era, significant ad-\nvancements in personalization capabilities emerged. Deep learning-based methods became powerful\nmeans of modeling high-dimensional, nonlinear interactions between users and items. Neural col-\nlaborative filtering (He et al., 2017) combined deep neural networks with matrix factorization to\nenhance generalization capabilities. AutoRec (Sedhain et al., 2015) introduced autoencoder-based\ncollaborative filtering, demonstrating the potential of neural architectures for recommendation tasks.\nThe evolution toward industrial-scale mobile applications led to breakthrough hybrid architectures\nthat balanced memorization and generalization. Wide & Deep Learning (Cheng et al., 2016), devel-\noped by Google, combined linear models for memorization with deep neural networks for generaliza-\ntion, establishing a paradigm for large-scale recommender systems. Building upon this foundation,\nDeepFM (Guo et al., 2017) integrated factorization machines with deep neural networks for click-\nthrough rate prediction, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering while maintaining the\nabilitytomodelbothlow-orderandhigh-orderfeatureinteractions.

These advancements enabled mobile applications to deliver fine-grained,\nreal-time personalization across social media, e-commerce, and streaming platforms.\nThe incorporation of temporal dynamics became crucial for mobile environments where user behav-\nior patterns change rapidly. Sequence-aware models such as GRU4Rec (Hidasi et al., 2016) emerged\nto model temporal patterns in user behavior, while contextual bandits addressed the exploration-\nexploitation trade-off in real-time recommendation scenarios. The introduction of attention mech-\nanisms and Transformer architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017) marked a significant advancement in\nsequential recommendation, enabling models to capture long-range dependencies and complex in-\nteraction patterns. Contemporary developments have focused on attention-based models and self-\nsupervised learning approaches optimized for mobile contexts. Transformer-based architectures like\nSASRec (Kang and McAuley, 2018) and BERT4Rec (Sun et al., 2019) have demonstrated superior\nperformance in sequential recommendation tasks by leveraging self-attention mechanisms to model\nuser behavior sequences. Graph Neural Networks have also emerged as powerful tools for modeling\ncomplex user-item interactions and social relationships (Wang et al., 2019).\n2.2.2 Attention Economy\nIn theMobile Web Era, Recommender Systems have not only transformed the manner in which users\naccess information but also significantly impacted commercial patterns. By leveraging user inter-\nests and behavioral data, Recommender Systems enable advertising and e-commerce platforms to\nprecisely target potential consumers with personalised content. For instance, e-commerce platforms\nanalyse users’ browsing histories and purchase records to suggest relevant products, thus enhancing\nthe shopping experience and significantly boosting conversion rates and sales. Similarly, social me-\ndia platforms employ Recommender Systems to present engaging content on homepages or feeds,\nthereby increasing user retention and interaction.\nThe advent of Recommender Systems precipitated a substantial evolution in the realm of online\nadvertising, characterised by enhanced targeting accuracy and the emergence of a behavior-driven\nadvertising pattern. This paradigm shift has given rise to the so-calledattention economy(Falkinger,\n2007; Ciampaglia et al., 2015; Davenport and Beck, 2018) where in each user action, such as a click,\nscroll, or pause, is considered a valuable data point. These platforms utilise the gathered data to\nenhance the delivery of advertisements in terms of format, timing, and frequency, thereby rendering\nthem more relevant and cost-effective. This behavior-based approach enables advertisers to achieve\nhigher marketing efficiency at lower costs.\nOverall, Recommender Systems have improved both the efficiency and personalization of information\naccess while emerging as a pivotal force in the commercialization of the Web. Through intelligent\ncontent distribution, they have redefined commercial interactions and consumption patterns. Their\nwidespread adoption in theMobile Web Erasignals a shift from a supply-demand model to a more\nintricate, behavior-driven interaction paradigm between information and commerce.\n2.3 Agentic Web Era\nThe evolution of the Web is undergoing a paradigm shift from a human-centric information retrieval\nmodel to an agent-centric action-oriented framework.\nThefoundationforthistransitionwasestablishedbybreakthroughsinLLMs(OpenAI,2024b;Dubey\net al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025), which demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language\nunderstanding, reasoning, and code generation.

These tasks demand a comprehensive understanding\nof context, the ability to dynamically adjust strategies, and the integration of multiple tools and\ndata sources.\nTraditional single-function assistants are increasingly inadequate for addressing the demands of\ncomplex, multi-step tasks. In response, multi-agent systems have emerged as a critical architectural\nsolution. A multi-agent system comprises multiple autonomous agents, each specialized in a specific\nsub-task such as information retrieval, translation, computation, or API interaction. These agents\ncollaborate through mechanisms including task decomposition, capability scheduling, and inter-\nagent information sharing, thereby enabling the system to tackle problems of greater complexity and\nscale. The development of AI orchestration frameworks, such as LangChain (Chen et al., 2023a)\nand AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023), supports the integration of models, tools, and service components\ninto structuredgraph task flows. These flows facilitate coordinated execution and dynamic decision-\nmaking among agents in a flexible and modular fashion, as illustrated in Figure 5. This collaborative\nparadigm significantly enhances both the breadth and depth of task execution. As a result, the\nWeb is undergoing a transformation from a static “information network” to a dynamic “action\nnetwork” in which autonomous systems are capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within\ndigital environments.\nHowever, this shift to multi-agent systems brings with it the need for sophisticated infrastructure\nto support these complex, agent-driven tasks. The advancement of the Agentic Web is not purely\nconceptual, it is increasingly grounded in real-world infrastructure developments. A key example of\nthis transformation is Microsoft’s recent move towards the Agentic Web, announced at Build 2025.\nOver 50 AI agent tools have been integrated across platforms such as GitHub, Azure, Microsoft 365,\nand Windows. These tools support every stage of agent deployment, from development and orches-\ntration to memory management and inference optimization. They offer a unified environment for\nbuilding and operating intelligent agents. Additionally, NLWeb (Natural Language Web) (Microsoft\nCorporate Blogs, 2025) has emerged as a toolset designed to convert traditional web interfaces into\nagent-readable, structured environments. This enables agents to navigate and interact with websites\nin a goal-driven manner, rather than relying on outdated and brittle methods like DOM scraping or\nsimulated clicks.\n12"}

It is\nno longer just a place for human-centric browsing but a dynamic, agent-driven environment where\nintelligent agents can perform complex tasks on behalf of users. In this context, agent protocols like\nthe MCP (Anthropic, 2024b) are playing a crucial role in enabling communication and collaboration\nbetween various services and agents. The establishment of these protocols is laying the foundation\nfor a more standardized, scalable agent-Web interaction layer, further advancing the Agentic Web.\n2.3.2 Agent Attention Economy\nThe advent of communication protocols such as the MCP has precipitated a trend of standardisation,\nregistration, and organization of external tools and services within the agent ecosystem, which is\nanalogous to the “yellow pages” directory. This facilitates agents’ access to and invocation of these\nresources through a unified interface. However, as the number of external resource providers, such\nas APIs, remote services, and data endpoints, grows rapidly, a new challenge emerges: how can\nagents efficiently discover, filter, and select the most suitable capabilities in a highly fragmented and\ndynamic service landscape (Yang et al., 2025f)?\nThischallengegivesrisetothenotionofthe AgentAttentionEconomy . Inamanneranalogousto\nthe early Web’s competition for user clicks, external services now compete to be selected and invoked\nby autonomous agents. In this paradigm, the focus shifts from the human users to the agent engaged\nin the execution of a sophisticated task. Every tool, service, or other agent essentially competes for\nlimited “agent attention”. To improve visibility and invocation likelihood, these entities may adopt\nmechanisms such as advertising, ranking optimization, or even agent-oriented recommendation and\nscoring systems within the service registries.\nAs this competition intensifies, it is reasonable to hypothesise that a comprehensive advertising in-\nfrastructure tailored for agents will emerge, which will include agent-facing recommendation engines,\ncapability reranking systems, inter-agent referral networks, and potentially auction-based ranking or\ncontext-aware ad insertion. This shift fundamentally redefines how agents discover and coordinate\nwith external resources, accelerating the transformation from a human-centric to an agent-centric\nWeb. This attention-based competition among agents may ultimately become a core mechanism\nfor resource allocation in future Web platforms, signalling a profound restructuring of both the\narchitectural and economic foundations of the Web.\n2.4 Commercial and Structural Evolution of the Web\nThe Web has evolved through three distinct eras: the PC Web, the Mobile Web, and the Agentic\nWeb. Table 1 provides a comparative overview of how the Web’s architecture, attention focus,\nand commercial models have evolved across eras. This section analyzes how innovations such as\nPageRank, recommender systems, and agent protocols like MCP have transformed the architecture\nand commercial dynamics of the Web, laying the foundation for an agent-native ecosystem in which\ninformation is dynamically generated and acted upon by autonomous systems.\nIn thePC Web Era, information was primarily hosted on static web pages, often published by in-\nstitutions and accessed through keyword-based search engines. Discovery hinged on link analysis\nalgorithms such as PageRank, and content was structured like a digital directory, manually navigable\nand hierarchically classified. Web content was sparse and predominantly produced by organizations,\nmeaning it was centralized and often top-down.

This explosion in informa-\ntion created a need for more sophisticated ways of navigating and discovering content. In response,\nRecommender Systems emerged as the dominant access paradigm. These systems relied on algo-\nrithms to curate content tailored to individual users, shifting the burden of content discovery from\nusers to algorithms. Users became both producers and consumers of content, with recommendation\nalgorithms acting as intermediaries. Commercial models adapted to this new logic, emphasizing\nmetrics like conversion rate, dwell time, and effective cost per mille, highlighting engagement depth\nand monetization precision.\nToday, in the emergingAgentic Web Era, both the commercial logic and the structure of information\nare undergoing a radical transformation. Unlike earlier paradigms, where knowledge was stored in\ndatabases or presented on web pages, LLMs embed vast amounts of web-scale information within\ntheir parameters through pretraining. This in-parameter knowledge enables LLM-based agents to\nreason, and respond based on learned representations rather than direct document lookups. In\nparallel, intelligent agents are developing the ability to interact not only with web pages, but also\nwith other agents, APIs, and tools in a dynamic, goal-driven fashion. The Web is thus shifting\nfrom a passive content repository to an active, agent-mediated action space, where agents act as\nautonomous intermediaries executing tasks on behalf of users.\n14"}

New protocols like the MCP are\nenabling agents to dynamically compose and orchestrate services from a modular ecosystem, leading\nto the development of agent-driven commercial models. Future monetization metrics may depend on\nfactors such as invocation frequency, capability relevance, and successful task completion, marking\na departure from the previous era’s focus on user interaction and direct advertising. This shift is\ngiving rise to new forms of agent-oriented advertising and bidding systems, designed not to persuade\nusers directly, but to influence agent decision-making pipelines.\nStructurally, the Web is being redefined from a human-readable medium into an agent-native sub-\nstrate. On the consumption side, agents can proactively summarize, recommend, or execute tasks\non behalf of users, offering unprecedented personalization and efficiency. These agents are capable\nof operating continuously across different services, becoming autonomous digital intermediaries. On\nthe production side, content will increasingly be generated by agents rather than humans. Agents\ncan autonomously generate articles, compose marketing material, or structure data for other agents\nto consume. This results in an emergent agent-to-agent communication layer, where content may\nnever be explicitly rendered for human eyes, but is optimized for agent parsing, reasoning, and\norchestration.\nTaken together, these shifts point toward a profound reconfiguration of the Web’s ontology: from\nhuman-readable documents, to algorithm-curated feeds, to agent-native knowledge. No longer will\nthe Web simply serve as a repository of static documents or a curated feed of personalized content,\nbut rather as a dynamic, interactive space where information flows are synthesized, shared, and\nexecuted by autonomous systems on behalf of humans. Over time, this could lead to the rise of\nan “Agent-Oriented Web,” where information is not merely personalized for individual users, but is\ndynamically created, shared, and executed through collaboration between intelligent agents.\n3 The Agentic Web\nThe Web is undergoing a fundamental transformation (Petrova et al., 2025; Lù et al., 2025; Chaf-\nfer, 2025). In the traditional model, users served as active navigators: searching, comparing, and\nmanually executing each digital step. Booking a flight, for instance, required visiting multiple travel\nwebsites, comparing ticket options, checking loyalty programs, and handling confirmation emails\nacross services. With the rise of intelligent agents, this burden is shifting. Users now increasingly\ndelegate goals rather than execute tasks. A travel agent AI can autonomously search for optimal\nflights based on personal calendar availability, loyalty points, and real-time pricing. It can coordinate\nwith hotel agents or even adjust travel plans based on weather forecasts or meeting changes (Mon-\nica, 2024; Genspark, 2025). This represents a shift from user-driven web navigation to intent-driven\norchestration, where outcomes rather than page views become the primary metric of value.\nThis evolution mirrors a broader arc in the history of the Internet. In the PC Web Era, users\nmanually navigated hyperlinks like explorers in a vast library. In the Mobile Web Era, apps curated\nthe experience and brought information to users more proactively. Yet users still had to operate\nthe system by opening apps, copying data, and making decisions. Now, in the Agentic Web, users\nact more like directors who articulate their intent while intelligent agents carry out the necessary\noperations behind the scenes.\nThese transformations are not merely technological but conceptual.

These\nmodelsembedknowledgewithintheirstructuresandsupporton-demandreasoning, therebyreducing\nreliance on traditional external web sources (Petrova et al., 2025; Lù et al., 2025).\nAt the same time, the way information is linked is also changing. Rather than relying on static\nhyperlinks, agents discover resources, services, and other agents through semantic discovery and\nadaptive integration (Touvron et al., 2023b; OpenAI, 2024a; Guo et al., 2025). This results in\na more fluid and context-sensitive form of connectivity, where relevance is inferred rather than\nexplicitly declared.\nAs agents gain content generation capabilities, information production is shifting beyond human-\nauthored web pages toward agent-generated outputs such as tools, instructions, summaries, and\nstructured artifacts designed for other agents (Qin et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023). This creates\na self-sustaining loop in which agents both generate and consume content, leading to increasingly\nautonomous and self-reinforcing information flows.\nThis structural shift in how information is stored (in-model versus in-document), linked (semantic\nversus hyperlink), and accessed (agent-driven versus search-driven) underpins the transition to the\nAgentic Web.\n3.2.3 Dual Operational Roles\nWithin this transformed architecture, agents operate through two complementary foundational per-\nspectives that represent different facets of their functionality:\n• Agent-as-User (Downward-facing): AI agents operate as autonomous web users who\ncan independently navigate, interact with, and consume web resources (Nakano et al., 2022;\nDeng et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023b; Gur et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2025; Monica, 2024). In this\nrole, agents replace or augment human users in web navigation and task execution, engaging\nwith existing web interfaces and services designed for human consumption. This enables\ncontinuous, 24/7 operation for tasks such as market research, data collection, or transaction\nprocessing.\n• Agent-as-Interface (Upward-facing):AI agents serve as intelligent intermediaries be-\ntween human users and web systems, translating high-level user intentions into executable\n17"}

These agents pro-\ncess natural language commands from users and orchestrate complex multi-step workflows\nacross various web services. This perspective emphasizes the agent’s role in abstracting\ncomplexity and providing streamlined human-agent interaction.\nThese perspectives are complementary rather than contradictory. A single agent system often em-\nbodies both roles: interacting autonomously with the web while serving as an interface for human\nusers and forming a bidirectional bridge between intention and execution. Together, these opera-\ntional perspectives, interaction transformations, and information structure changes operationalize\nthe Agentic Web’s core vision: a distributed, interactive internet ecosystem in which autonomous\nsoftware agents engage in persistent, goal-directed interactions to plan, coordinate, and execute tasks\non behalf of human users.\n3.3 Three Conceptual Dimensions of the Agentic Web\nTo understand the Agentic Web in depth, we propose a conceptual framework built on three interre-\nlateddimensions: Intelligence, Interaction, andEconomy. Eachdimensionreflectsacorerequirement\nfor autonomous operation within digital ecosystems as illustrated in Figure 6).\nAt its core, the Intelligence Dimension equips agents with reasoning capabilities such as perception,\nplanning, and learning. Building on this, the Interaction Dimension enables agents to connect with\ndigital environments through semantic protocols and dynamic tool use. The Economic Dimension\nfocuses on how agents autonomously create, exchange, and distribute value, forming self-organizing\ndigital economies.\nEach layer builds upon the previous one: intelligence enables interaction, and interaction enables\nvalue creation. This layered view explains how agents evolve from internal reasoning entities to\nimpactful economic participants.\nConceptual Layers\n• Intelligence Dimension: What core intelligence is required for agents to function\nautonomously?\n• Interaction Dimension: How do agents communicate and coordinate within digital\necosystems?\n• Economic Dimension:How do agents generate and exchange value at scale?\n3.3.1 Intelligence Dimension\nThe Intelligence Dimension provides the cognitive foundation that enables agents to reason, learn,\nand plan within open-ended digital environments. Unlike traditional systems that rely on human\nqueries, agents access and act on information autonomously. They draw from both internalized\nknowledge (in-parameter models) (Koh et al., 2024; Putta et al., 2024; Masterman et al., 2024;\nWu et al., 2025) and external resources (via tools and APIs) (Qin et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023;\nParanjape et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2025), shifting from passive retrieval to proactive information use.\nTo operate effectively, agents require transferable intelligence rather than narrowly defined, task-\nspecific heuristics. Key capabilities include:\n• Contextual Understanding: Agents should be able to interpret diverse forms of web-\nbased input, including natural language, semi-structured data, and interface signals, all\nwithin task-specific and evolving contexts.\n• Long-Horizon Planning: Agents must formulate, evaluate, and revise multi-step strate-\ngies to achieve both short-term objectives and long-term goals across diverse digital services.\n18"}

Instead, they interpret, strate-\ngize, and adapt independently. Without these cognitive abilities, agents cannot handle real-world\nambiguity, recover from failure, or scale across services.\n3.3.2 Interaction Dimension\nThe Interaction Dimension addresses a fundamental shift in how autonomous agents engage with\nthe digital environment. This shift moves the web away from static, human-authored hyperlinks\ntowarddynamic, context-awareconnections. Intraditionalwebarchitectures, interactionisprimarily\ndocument-based and mediated by human users. In contrast, agents in the Agentic Web interact\nthrough semantic protocols and runtime service discovery, allowing them to initiate and manage\ninteractions without relying on predefined links or manual input.\nThe emergence of agent-native communication protocols has been a key catalyst for this transforma-\ntion (Chang, 2024; Cisco, 2025; AI and Data, 2025; Yang et al., 2025d), such as the MCP (Anthropic,\n2024b). Unlike conventional APIs that rely on stateless, transactional exchanges, MCP supports\npersistent, semantically coherent dialogues between agents and services. It introduces three foun-\ndational capabilities: (1)dynamic capability discovery, allowing agents to identify available system\nfunctionalities at runtime; (2)semantic context preservation, which maintains task continuity across\nmulti-step workflows; and (3)privacy-aware collaboration, enabling rich information exchange while\nprotecting sensitive data. Together, these features mark a shift from procedural invocation toward\nadaptive, negotiated interactions.\nBeyond communication, the Interaction Dimension underpinstool orchestration, the agent’s ability\nto safely compose and sequence external capabilities. Agents can dynamically verify tool properties,\nauthenticate requests, and execute operations within controlled environments, minimizing risks such\nas malicious injection or execution failures.\nFurthermore, this dimension facilitatesagent-to-agent coordination. Protocols like Agent-to-Agent\n(A2A) (Google, 2025b) enable agents to form ad hoc coalitions, share intermediate outputs, and\ncollaboratively pursue complex goals. Such cooperative frameworks transform the Agentic Web into\na networked fabric of interacting intelligences, where distributed reasoning and shared context allow\nagents to operate not just individually, but collectively.\nBy integrating semantic interoperability, safe tool access, and inter-agent collaboration, the Inter-\naction Dimension forms the operational substrate of the Agentic Web. It allows autonomous agents\nto engage with a dynamic, heterogeneous environment in an adaptive and meaningful way as shown\nin Figure 7.\n3.3.3 Economic Dimension\nThe Economic Dimension reconfigures digital ecosystems by introducing autonomous agents as eco-\nnomicactorscapableofinitiatingtransactions, formingcollaborations, andallocatingresourceswith-\nout direct human input.

The figure illustrates three foundational\ntransitions from Traditional Web to Agentic Web paradigms.\nin information retrieval, recommendation systems, and agent architectures are converging and trans-\nforming to form the core capabilities of autonomous agents operating within dynamic web environ-\nments. We delineate three foundational transitions that characterize this algorithmic evolution, as\nillustrated in Figure 8: (1) from user-centric information retrieval to proactive agentic information\nacquisition, where systems transition from reactive document lookup to autonomous, context-aware\ndata gathering; (2) from static, one-shot recommendation to dynamic, goal-oriented agent planning,\nrepresenting a shift from isolated preference predictions to integrated reasoning-action frameworks;\nand (3) from isolated single-agent execution to complex multi-agent coordination, enabling dis-\ntributed intelligence and collaborative problem-solving capabilities. Each transition signifies a fun-\ndamental evolution from fixed, domain-specific pipelines that require explicit human intervention\nto adaptive, context-aware strategies that can autonomously navigate uncertainty and complexity.\nThese transformations collectively establish the algorithmic foundation for intelligent systems ca-\npable of independent operation, continuous learning, and emergent behavior. Such characteristics\ndistinguish the Agentic Web from its predecessors, with implications extending beyond technical im-\nprovements to encompass new possibilities for human-AI collaboration, automated decision-making,\nand the emergence of truly autonomous digital agents.\n4.1 User-centric Retrieval to Agentic Information Retrieval\nTraditional information retrieval has historically been grounded in human-initiated, document-\ncentric search methodologies. Foundational techniques such as the bag-of-words model and term\nfrequency-inverse document frequency (Spärck Jones, 1972) assign weights to terms based on their\nfrequency within a document and their rarity across the corpus, thus producing a basic relevance\nsignal for ad hoc queries. Probabilistic models such as Okapi BM25 (Robertson et al., 1995) intro-\nduced refinements by incorporating term-frequency saturation and document-length normalization,\nenabling more effective handling of heterogeneous document sizes and term distributions. With the\nadvent of the web, link-analysis algorithms such as PageRank (Page et al., 1999) contributed by\nmodeling a random surfer traversing the hyperlink graph, introducing authority as a critical factor\nin ranking. More recent advances have leveraged supervised Learning to Rank approaches, which\napply pointwise, pairwise, or listwise machine learning objectives to optimize ranking functions using\nlabeled relevance data, significantly improving performance over traditional unsupervised methods\n(Liu et al., 2009).\n21"}

Rather than performing static keyword-based queries, autonomous agents dynamically\nassess their goals, environment, and task progression to determine what information is needed,\nwhen to acquire it, and through which modalities (Zhang et al., 2024a). These agents engage in\ncomplex, multi-step retrieval pipelines that often involve domain-specific tools, external APIs, and\nprocedural logic, enabling them to construct knowledge on demand. This transition from passive\nsearch to proactive information acquisition supports end-to-end workflows that require minimal\nhuman supervision, enhancing both task generalization and responsiveness.\nRAG architectures exemplify this shift by grounding language model outputs in external, verifiable\ncontent (Lewis et al., 2020). Within this framework, Fusion-in-Decoder retrieves relevant passages\nvia sparse or dense indexes and integrates them with the input query in a sequence-to-sequence\nmodel such as T5 (Izacard and Grave, 2021). FLARE adopts an iterative retrieval strategy in which\nthe model forecasts the next sentence, uses low-confidence predictions to formulate pseudo-queries,\nand refines the output through successive retrieval rounds (Jiang et al., 2023). SELF-RAG intro-\nduces a self-reflective loop that prompts the model to critique and revise its own responses, thereby\nenhancing factual accuracy (Asai et al., 2024). RetrievalQA explores adaptive retrieval policies that\nallow models to determine whether and when to retrieve based on internal uncertainty estimates\n(Zhang et al., 2024c). The Tree of Clarifications framework (Kim et al., 2023) addresses query\nambiguity by decomposing questions into clarifying subqueries, retrieving evidence for each, and\nsynthesizing comprehensive answers. Toolformer extends these capabilities by enabling models to\nautonomously identify suitable APIs, invoke them at appropriate stages, and incorporate the outputs\ninto subsequent token generation (Schick et al., 2023). Collectively, these innovations demonstrate\nhow deeply integrated retrieval mechanisms enhance agent reasoning, supporting sophisticated tasks\nsuch as information synthesis, procedural decision-making, and tool utilization, thereby establishing\nthe Agentic Web as a foundation for scalable and intelligent autonomous interaction.\n4.2 Recommendation to Agent Planning\nThe traditional recommendation paradigm, which centers on matching users with items, is reinter-\npreted in the context of the Agentic Web as a strategic and goal driven framework for planning\nand execution. Earlier systems employed algorithms such as user based and item based collabo-\nrative filtering (Sarwar et al., 2001), matrix factorization methods (Koren et al., 2009), and deep\nlearning based recommendation models (He et al., 2017) to estimate user preferences over static\ncontent. While these techniques are effective at retrieving individually relevant items, they operate\nin a reactive manner: each recommendation is an isolated prediction that neglects downstream task\ndependencies and does not support multi step workflows. Modern advances have fundamentally\ntranscended these limitations through the introduction of sophisticated architectural innovations\nthat enable autonomous goal oriented behavior. Language Agent Tree Search exemplifies this evolu-\ntion by integrating MCTS with LLM powered value functions and self reflection mechanisms (Zhou\net al., 2023a).\nIn contrast, the Agentic Web redefines recommendation as a proactive process involving multi step\nplanning by autonomous agents. This conceptual shift has led to the development of agents powered\nby large language models that integrate high level reasoning with executable actions in dynamic\nweb environments.

Beyond these foundational approaches, recent developments have introduced so-\nphisticated memory augmented systems such as the Task Memory Engine, which implements spatial\nmemory using Directed Acyclic Graphs to replace linear context concatenation (Ye, 2025). GoalAct\ndemonstrates continuous global planning that maintains clear objectives through skill based decom-\nposition and hierarchical execution strategies, achieving improvement in success rates on complex\nlegal benchmarks (Chen et al., 2025).\nThis evolution represents a fundamental transition from passive recommendation to prescriptive\nand goal oriented behavior, empowering agents to autonomously interpret instructions, navigate\nweb environments, and manipulate digital interfaces in pursuit of complex user defined objectives.\nThe emergence of standardized evaluation frameworks such as WebArena (Zhou et al., 2023b),\nVisualWebArena (Koh et al., 2024), and ST-WebAgentBench (Levy et al., 2024) has established\ncomprehensive protocols for assessing multi dimensional agent capabilities across planning, tool in-\ntegration, safety, and trustworthiness. Contemporary agents demonstrate substantial performance\ngains through enhanced autonomous task completion capabilities, while standardized protocols in-\ncluding the Model Context Protocol and Agent Communication Protocol enable seamless integration\nacross heterogeneous agent systems (Anthropic, 2025; Li et al., 2024a).\n4.3 Single-Agent to Multi-Agent Coordination\nTraditional single-agent systems have typically modeled autonomous decision-making in web envi-\nronments using the Markov Decision Process framework. Early work by Shani et al. demonstrated\nthat formulating recommendation tasks as sequential optimization problems outperformed static\napproaches in maximizing long-term user satisfaction (Shani et al., 2005). Building on this foun-\ndation, contextual bandit algorithms such as LinUCB were developed to adaptively select content\nby incorporating user and contextual information, improving cumulative engagement through it-\nerative learning (Li et al., 2010). To address the bias and sparsity inherent in logged interaction\ndata, off-policy actor-critic methods with top-K corrections have been successfully scaled to large\nrecommender systems, enhancing stability and effectiveness in environments with millions of candi-\ndate actions (Chen et al., 2019). Additionally, slate-based reinforcement learning (RL) decomposes\nmulti-item recommendation problems into tractable value functions, enabling efficient Q-learning\nover complex combinatorial action spaces (Ie et al., 2019). Although these single-agent approaches\nare effective for optimizing individual objectives, they face limitations in scenarios that require col-\nlaboration, distributed reasoning, or task-level adaptability.\nTo address these limitations, multi-agent coordination frameworks have emerged to enable dynamic\ncollaboration among agents, allowing them to collectively solve tasks that are difficult to address\nin isolation. This paradigm shift supports task decomposition, role specialization, and orchestrated\nexecution through communication and shared goals. AutoGen exemplifies this transition by imple-\nmenting planner, executor, and critic roles, using prompt conditioning to assign responsibilities and\nstructure inter-agent interaction (Wu et al., 2023). AgentOccam enhances LLM-based agents not\nby refining agent strategies alone, but by improving their fundamental reasoning and task compre-\nhension capabilities (Yang et al., 2025a).

These developments\ncollectively reflect a broader shift toward distributed intelligence, demonstrating the increasing\nimportance of collaboration, modularity, and specialization in next-generation autonomous systems.\n5 Systematic Transitions of the Agentic Web\nThe shift toward an Agentic Web entails not only a conceptual evolution but also a fundamental\nredesign of the underlying system architecture. Traditional web infrastructure, based on stateless\nprotocols, user-initiated interfaces, and staticinteraction models, is poorly suitedto the requirements\nofagenticcomputation. Tofunctioneffectively, autonomousagentsnecessitatecontinuouscontextual\nawareness, persistent sessions, dynamic service discovery, semantically rich interaction protocols, and\nreal-time coordination with both human users and other agents.\nThis section articulates the system-level transformations necessary to support agent-native execu-\ntion. It identifies the limitations of current web protocols and runtime environments, proposes\ninfrastructure requirements for persistent, context-aware agents, and discusses the evolution of com-\nmunication standards that enable semantic, agent-to-agent interactions. By analyzing these transi-\ntions systematically, this section contributes a coherent architectural perspective for operationalizing\nthe Agentic Web beyond isolated prototypes or platform-specific implementations.\nWe begin by outlining the core system challenges that arise when deploying autonomous agents in\nweb-scale environments.\n5.1 Motivation for an Agentic Web System\nThe advent of the Agentic Web, a paradigm characterized by autonomous, intelligent agents ex-\necuting complex user-delegated tasks, represents a fundamental architectural evolution from the\ncontent-centric model of the contemporary internet. This transition necessitates a profound re-\nengineering of underlying network and system architectures, as the internet’s extant infrastructure\nis ill-equipped to support the dynamic, decentralized, and mission-critical nature of agentic opera-\ntions. For this emergent ecosystem to become viable, several core system-level challenges must be\nsurmounted, transforming the internet from a passive data conduit into an intelligent, proactive,\nand service-aware fabric.\nA primary impediment to the realization of the Agentic Web is the challenge of agent discovery. In\ncontrast to the static addressing schemes of the traditional internet, where resources are located via\nstable IP addresses or domain names, autonomous agents are ephemeral and lack a fixed, identifiable\nnetwork location. When a principal agent must execute a task exceeding its intrinsic capabilities,\nit must dynamically recruit other agents. This scenario presents a critical problem: the identifi-\ncation and selection of suitable collaborators from a vast, decentralized population of agents. The\nresolution of this problem requires a dynamic discovery mechanism, analogous in principle but su-\nperior in intelligence to network routing protocols (Cui et al., 2025). For a given task, the system\nmust effectively source and select agents by conducting a comprehensive assessment of their skills,\nreadiness, and suitability to the specific operational demands. This \"just-in-time\" matchmaking is a\nprerequisite for the seamless, on-demand collaboration essential for executing complex, multi-agent\noperations (Chen et al., 2024b; Raskar et al., 2025).\nSubsequent to discovery, the challenge of effective inter-agent communication arises, with the cur-\nrent ecosystem of APIs presenting a significant roadblock. Contemporary APIs are predominantly\nengineered for consumption by human developers, achieving syntactic but not semantic interoper-\nability. While they rigorously define the structure for data exchange, they lack the formal semantic"}

To transcend this\nlimitation, a new paradigm of agent-oriented APIs is required. A future standard would likely ne-\ncessitate the integration of machine-readable formalisms, such as ontologies or logical specifications,\ndirectly within the API definition. This would create a unified system wherein an agent can ac-\ncess not only the syntactic structure but also the semantic context, thereby empowering agents to\nautonomously discover, comprehend, and utilize APIs to perform complex tasks without human\nintervention (Braubach et al., 2018).\nFurthermore, thehighlydynamicanddistributednatureofthisnetworkintroducescomplexlogistical\nchallenges related to billing and accounting. In a system where agents can spontaneously collaborate,\ndelegate sub-tasks, and consume services from one another, tracking resource utilization for the\npurposeofaccurateattributionandbillingbecomesexceptionallydifficult. Apersistent, reliable, and\nauditable methodology is needed to monitor the chain of interactions and associate computational\nand service costs with the originating user or principal agent. This necessitates the design of a\ntransactional framework capable of tracing an agent’s activities and resource consumption across a\nfluid, multi-party network. Such a framework must securely bind billing information to a specific\nentity, ensuringthatasagentsaccesspremiumservicesordelegatepaidtasks, theassociatedcostsare\naccurately calculated and charged (Cui et al., 2025). Without a robust solution for micropayments\nand distributed accounting, the economic models required to sustain a sophisticated, service-driven\nAgentic Web are untenable.\nFinally, a foundational challenge resides in the evolution of the network infrastructure itself: specif-\nically, the transition from a best-effort network to an intelligent infrastructure capable of delivering\nguaranteed, personalized quality of service. The current network architecture, exemplified by 5G, is\nfundamentally network-centric, engineered to optimize a limited set of aggregated KPIs, such as peak\ndata rate and latency. This model, while effective for enhancing general system capabilities, is insuf-\nficient for the Agentic Web, which demands a paradigm shift from optimizing universal metrics to\nproviding bespoke, task-specific service guarantees. The infrastructure must evolve to comprehend\nand dynamically accommodate the distinct, multi-dimensional requirements of individual agentic\ntasks. This transition reflects a shift from providing generalized high-performance capabilities to\nacting as an intelligent orchestrator that interprets specific task requirements across multiple di-\nmensions, including cost, security, and access to knowledge, and provisions tailored Service Level\nAgreements accordingly.\nFigure 9 illustrates a task’s Service Requirement Zone (SRZ) (Yang et al., 2023b), an eight-\ndimensional profile defining its quality of experience needs across metrics like cost, delay, security,\ndata rate, and knowledge. The size of the shaded SRZ on the chart indicates the stringency of these\nneeds: a smaller zone means more exacting demands, requiring precise resource orchestration.

It has a high demand for\nKnowledge to access specialized models, strong Reliability and Stability, and low Delay to enable\ninteractive analysis. This profile necessitates a highly capable and responsive service.\nIn contrast, the Ticket Purchase Assistant (right) has a larger, more flexible SRZ. This agent’s\nprimary needs are high Security for processing payments and a high Data Rate to quickly load\noptions. It can tolerate longer delays and has minimal requirements for energy or local storage,\nwhich is typical for a transactional task. This comparison highlights how different agents have\nunique service profiles that the underlying infrastructure must be able to interpret and fulfill.\nTo adequately support the Agentic Web, the underlying infrastructure must therefore evolve to\nnatively interpret and fulfill these diverse SRZs. It can no longer treat the VR stream and the\nbanking transaction as fungible data flows. The system must transition from network-level slicing to\na far more granular mode of service provisioning at the individual task level (Liu et al., 2025a; Chen\net al., 2024a). To achieve this, the network requires pervasive, embedded intelligence, allowing it to\nefficiently identify a task’s SRZ and subsequently orchestrate heterogeneous network, compute, and\ndata resources across multiple domains to guarantee that its specific quality of experience is met,\nthus marking a definitive departure from the legacy “best-effort” paradigm (Mahmood et al., 2024;\nWang et al., 2024b).\nThe paradigm shift towards SRZ-centric service delivery imposes a set of unprecedented demands\non the underlying system architecture that far surpass the capabilities of the traditional web. The\nsystem must support extreme dynamism and negotiation, as an agent’s resource needs can change\ndramatically mid-task, requiring real-time allocation adjustments (Huang et al., 2024; Zhang et al.,\n2025c). It must natively handle multimodality, intelligently managing the varied requirements of\ntext, image, audio, and other data types. The system’s role must also evolve from a mere data\ntransporter to a capability-driven orchestrator, maintaining a real-time inventory of computational\nresources, AI models, and data sources to fulfill agent requests (Li et al., 2025a). Furthermore, it\nmust provide granular, verifiable security and privacy controls at the level of individual agents and\nsub-tasks, offer deep observability for robust debugging and optimization, and incorporate intelligent\ncost control mechanisms to manage computationally expensive agentic workflows (Li et al., 2025a).\n5.2 Toward a Next-Generation Agentic Web System\nTo facilitate the large-scale deployment of autonomous agents, the Web must evolve from a content-\ncentric medium to an execution-oriented infrastructure. This paradigm shift necessitates a funda-\nmental re-evaluation of web systems’ architectural foundations to support agent-native interaction\npatterns, persistent context management, and integrated tool orchestration.\nIn this subsection, we present the Agentic Web system, which integrates three essential elements: the\nUser Client, the Intelligent Agent, and Backend Services. We elucidate the functional roles of each\ncomponent, examine their historical evolution, and analyze their collective function in translating\nhigh-level user goals into executable digital actions. By articulating this architecture, we establish\na conceptual framework for understanding how agentic capabilities can be operationalized, thereby\nbridging the divide between user intent and dynamic service execution.\n5.2.1 Roadmap of the Agentic Web System\nThis section delineates the architecture of the Agentic Web, a tripartite structure designed to trans-\nlate user objectives into executable operations.

Lever-\naging artificial intelligence disciplines such as Natural Language Processing, the agent discerns user\nintent, decomposes complex objectives into granular sub-tasks, and selects appropriate backend tools\nfor execution. The developmental path of these agents has advanced from rudimentary rule-based\nsystems to sophisticated learning models. These modern agents are capable of addressing complex\ncreative and epistemic tasks by continuously adapting based on new data and user feedback.\nBackend Services, Tools, and Plugins form the functional substrate, providing the essential computa-\ntional, data, and specialized capabilities required by the agent. These modular resources encompass\na wide spectrum of functions, from general utilities like language translation to domain-specific in-\ndustry applications. Architecturally, they have evolved from monolithic databases to a distributed\nand extensible ecosystem of microservices and plugins, which permits third-party developers to\ncontinuously augment the capabilities of the Agentic Web.\nTo illustrate the interoperability of these components, consider a representative interaction workflow.\nThe process is initiated when the User Client transmits a high-level objective, such as “plan a\nbusiness trip to Shanghai,” to the Agent. The Agent then decomposes this objective into constituent\nsub-tasks. It subsequently identifies and invokes the requisite external services, such as flight and\nhotel booking platforms, to execute these tasks. Upon receiving the necessary information, the\nAgent integrates these disparate results. It synthesizes the data, evaluates it against predefined user\nconstraints, and formulates a coherent, consolidated response—such as a complete itinerary—which\nis then relayed to the User Client for presentation.\nFurthermore, the architecture accommodates a direct interaction model. In certain scenarios, the\nAgent may orchestrate an initial connection, after which the User Client engages directly with\na backend service. This decoupled model is particularly advantageous for transactions involving\nsensitive data or requiring high-throughput, such as financial payments. This design allows the\nAgent to preserve its function as the master coordinator while delegating specific interactions to\noptimize for security and efficiency.\n27"}

Within this paradigm, a user entrusts a high-\nlevel objective to an intelligent, autonomous Agent, which then orchestrates a diverse set of resources\nto achieve the specified outcome. The User Client functions as the dedicated human-computer\ninterface; the Agent operates as the central cognitive processor and orchestrator; and the Backend\nServices constitute an ecosystem of callable functionalities (e.g., APIs, databases, web applications)\ncapable of executing specific, well-defined tasks.\nThese rigorous requirements fundamentally invalidate the traditional Client-Server architecture,\nmandating a shift toward the Client-Agent-Server model. We propose an Agentic Web Architecture,\ndepicted in Figure10, to realize this paradigm. This architecture operates through three core com-\nponents. First, a demand skill vector mapper interprets application needs by performing context\nawareness, dynamic intent tracking, and semantic vectorization to translate service demands into\nmachine-readable formats. Second, a real time task Router dynamically dispatches these vectorized\ntasks to a distributed Agent Framework operating across the edge and access networks. Third, a\ncross agent billing ledger governs the economic and resource interactions between agents, enabling\ncrucial functions like resource metering, service chaining, and privacy-preserving settlement. This in-\ntegrated design creates an intelligent, autonomous, and value-aware fabric for orchestrating complex\nagentic services.\n5.2.2 Interaction Process Example: Collaborative Mechanisms in Travel Itinerary\nPlanning by Agents\nAs depicted in Figure 11, the workflow is initiated upon the submission of the request, “Plan a 3-day\ntrip to Beijing,” through the User Client. A Request Parser agent semantically parses this input to\nextract key parameters, including the destination, duration, and the core user objective.\nSubsequently, a yool orchestrator agent decomposes the primary objective into four discrete sub-\ntasks: obtaining meteorological data, compiling information on tourist attractions, querying for\naccommodation options, and generating a route map. It then programmatically invokes the corre-\nsponding backend services via the MCP protocol:\n• Request forecast data from the Weather Service.\n• Request attraction information from the Travel Guide Service.\n• Request accommodation options from the Hotel Service.\n28"}

Key innovations include synergizing reasoning with action, architecturally\nseparating planning from execution, and establishing more reliable benchmarks to accurately mea-\nsure performance.\nReAct, a framework developed by (Yao et al., 2023) achieves synergy by interleaving reasoning\nand acting within large language models. The proposed methodology enhances the model’s per-\nformance in two key ways. First, it enables the generation of reasoning traces to formulate and\ndynamically adjust action plans. Second, it facilitates interaction with external resources, exempli-\nfied by a Wikipedia API, to retrieve information, which is essential for fact-checking and minimizing\nhallucinations. This dynamic combination of “acting to reason” and “reasoning to act” enables\nagents to more reliably solve knowledge-intensive tasks and enhances the interpretability of their\ndecision-making processes.\nTo tackle challenges in long-horizon tasks, the PLAN-AND-ACT framework (Erdogan et al., 2025)\ndistinctly segregates strategic high-level planning from immediate low-level actions. This architec-\nture features a PLANNER model dedicated to generating structured, abstract strategies and an\nEXECUTOR model responsible for translating these strategies into tangible steps in the environ-\nment. A key innovation of this framework is dynamic replanning, which addresses the limitations\nof static plans. The PLANNER updates the plan after each action is executed, enabling the agent\nto acclimate to evolving environmental conditions and incorporate new information, such as search\nresults, into the ongoing strategy.\nFor a more accurate measurement of true web agent capabilities, existing benchmarks like WebVoy-\nager have been identified as a key limitation, as they often suffer from a lack of task diversity and can\nreport inflated performance results (Xue et al., 2025; Deng et al., 2023). To address this, the new\nOnline-Mind2Web benchmark offers a comprehensive evaluation suite, containing 300 diverse and\nrealistic tasks that cover a broad spectrum of 136 websites. Concurrently, an automated evaluation\nmethod called WebJudge was also developed. This approach identifies key points for task comple-\ntion and then selects key screenshots from an agent’s trajectory for evaluation, preserving critical\ninformation while avoiding context length limits. This method achieves up to 85.7% agreement with\nhuman judgment and significantly improves evaluation reliability and scalability.\n5.3 Agentic Communication\nThe deployment of autonomous agents in complex web environments for multi step tasks introduces\nnovel communication demands that fundamentally exceed the capabilities of traditional web proto-\ncols.

We introduce two representative protocols, MCP and A2A, that exemplify emerging\napproaches to structured, scalable, and semantically rich communication among agents and ser-\nvices. The following subsections first analyze the design motivations behind these protocols and\nthen provide detailed descriptions of their architectures and workflows.\n5.3.1 Design Motivation (Beyond HTTP/RPC)\nIn the current Internet ecosystem, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Remote Procedure\nCall (RPC) have long served as the mainstream communication protocols, underpinning the data\ninteraction between Web services. Over the past two years, numerous AI Agent projects have\nachieved basic communication functions based on these two protocols. However, with the rise of\nthe Agentic Web concept, the limitations of traditional protocols have gradually become prominent.\nThe Agentic Web, characterized by autonomy, context awareness, and dynamic interaction, has\noperational mechanisms that impose new requirements on communication protocols far beyond the\ncapabilities of HTTP/RPC.\nFirstly, the task execution process in the Agentic Web typically involves collaboration among multi-\nple entities, which imposes stringent requirements on theefficient management of task specific\ncontext. In the Agentic Web, the task execution process frequently necessitates intricate interac-\ntions between designated agents and other agents, in addition to non-agent resources such as external\ntools, data, and services. During these interactions, all participating entities are required to main-\ntain, transmit, and share specific context, such as historical data or environmental configuration\nparameters. For example, when a personal assistant agent is assigned the task of arranging a travel\nitinerary for a user, it may need to query a weather API and interact with hotel and transportation\nbooking agents. Throughout this process, the involved entities must exchange both private and\nnon-private user data, including user preferences and authorizations, and share progress information\nrelated to the booking task. However, traditional web protocols (HTTP/RPC) are principally de-\nsigned for the transmission of data and lack semantic-level support. This design limitation results in\nthe treatment of complex context as ordinary data, with no distinction among higher-level seman-\ntic elements such ashistorical context, user intent, or environmental configuration. Furthermore,\nthese web protocols have been demonstrated to lack the capacity to process logical semantics, such\nas preconditions. Consequently, traditional web protocols are inadequate in meeting the stringent\ndemands of the Agentic Web for efficient context management during task execution.\nSecondly, the task execution process in the Agentic Web is contingent on LLM based agents, thereby\nengendering heightened requirements forsemantic accuracy in communication and interac-\ntion. In the Agentic Web, entities need to communicate through structured and standardized\nprotocols to ensure semantic consistency and operational feasibility during task execution. How-\never, LLM-based agents typically mediate their understanding and generation of structured content\nthrough natural language, introducing inherent non-determinism into the output process, which is\nsusceptible to issues such as formatting deviations and semantic drift, compromising the accuracy\nand reliability of interactions. Consider the case of traditional API calls, which rely on developers\nto interpret interface semantics from documentation and manually construct deterministic, struc-"}

Conversely, in the Agentic Web, agents are required to automatically interpret\ninterface semantics and translate natural language descriptions into operational commands. In the\nabsence of a semantically specified mechanism, the generated results are frequently unstable, which\ncomplicates the assurance of structural integrity and semantic correctness in API calls. Therefore,\nAgentic Web protocols provide machine-readable interface semantic specifications that explicitly\ndefine the data types, value ranges, and business meanings of each field. This can guide LLMs in\naccurately parsing and generating structured invocations. Furthermore, the protocol must address\nsemantic divergence across entities, for instance by unifying or mapping field labels such as “UID”\n30"}

However, traditional web protocols such as\nHTTP and RPC are primarily designed for data transport and lack support for interface semantics\nand field alignment. Consequently, they are insufficient for the semantic coordination and contextual\nunderstanding required.\nFinally, the task execution process in the Agentic Web requireshigh interactivityin communica-\ntion. The task execution process is frequently distinguished by protracted durations,multi-phase\nworkflows, and asynchronous operations. Furthermore, in circumstances involving sensitive ac-\ntions, immediate user intervention may be imperative. This necessitates that agent communication\nbe supported by persistent and dynamic interaction mechanisms. For instance, let us examine a case\nwhere a personal assistant agent is assigned the task of formulating a trading strategy. In such a case,\nthe agent may need to communicate intermediate results to the participant at different phases of\nthe procedure. In particular, if the task involves high-risk decisions or large financial transactions,\nthe agent must halt its operation until it receives an explicit confirmation from the user to con-\ntinue. The execution of such task workflows necessitates not only the possession of fine-grained task\ncontrol capabilities by agents but also the implementation of communication protocols that support\nevent-drivenarchitectures, asynchronousresponses, andpersistenttaskstatemanagement. However,\ntraditional web protocols such as HTTP and RPC typically adopt a synchronous request-response\nmodel and lack native support for long-running tasks. Furthermore, they are also ill-equipped to\nhandle complex control flows such as task suspension, external event injection, or dynamic user\nconfirmation. Whilst mechanisms such as polling and Webhooks can be utilized to facilitate partial\nasynchronous interactions, they frequently necessitate the implementation of additional logic layers,\nthereby increasing system complexity and compromising overall robustness. It is therefore vital that\nthe Agent Web urgently requires more capable and interaction-rich protocol mechanisms to support\nmulti-phase, multi-party task workflows in a more natural and efficient manner.\nAccording to the research in (Yang et al., 2025d), a large number of new agent communication\nprotocols emerged in the past year. Among them, the general-purpose protocols, MCP and A2A,\nhave demonstrated significant technical advantages and community influence. These two protocols\nare designed from different dimensions to address the characteristics of the Agentic Web, forming\ncomplementary solutions. We will provide a brief introduction to these two communication protocols\nand explain which key challenges faced by the Agentic Web they can address and how to address\nthem, followed by detailed introductions to their workflows.\nMCP, short for Model Context Protocol, proposed by Anthropic (Anthropic, 2024), is a communi-\ncation protocol focused on interactions between agents and non-agent resources. It aims to establish\nstandardized interfaces for tool invocation and has gradually evolved into a de facto industry stan-\ndard. Under the framework of this protocol, applications encapsulate the tools, resources, and\nprompts they provide into service units that can be recognized by agents. Agents obtain application\nmetadata, including function descriptions, input-output formats, and usage constraints, through\nthe query interface of the MCP, and implement the call and control of applications based on the\noperation instructions defined by the protocol. For example, when an agent needs to call an image-\ngeneration tool, it can obtain the parameter-configuration specifications of the tool through the\nMCP and submit the generation task in a standardized request format to ensure the consistency\nof cross-platform tool calls.

Finally, once the client agent determines that the task has\nbeen completed, the output is encapsulated and delivered in the form of anArtifact.\nCompared to the MCP, the A2A protocol not only expands the scope of agent communication\nto include direct interaction and collaboration between heterogeneous agents but also significantly\nimproves the management of context, messages, and tasks in multi-agent coordination, establishing\na strong structural association between these elements.\nSpecifically, the A2A protocol allocates a unique identifier to each context, creating an explicit link\nbetween tasks and their associated environments. This design allows for the more organized and\ntraceable management of multiple interrelated tasks, improving context consistency in complex sce-\nnarios and supporting robust task mechanisms. In addition, A2A introduces the unique identifier\nof the current task and a list of related task IDs for each message. This establishes a bidirectional,\nstructured link between messages and tasks, enabling semantic anchoring of messages to their corre-\nsponding tasks and historical referencing across tasks. Consequently, A2A supports context tracing\nthroughout multi-turn interactions, tool invocation sequences, and other temporally extended work-\nflows, forming coherent interaction chains. Unlike the MCP protocol, which has a loose coupling\nbetween tasks and messages, A2A’s tightly integrated design is better suited to complex collab-\noration scenarios, such as iterative dialogues and multi-agent tool orchestration. It significantly\nenhances the capabilities of systems in terms of state synchronisation, semantic coherence, and fault\ntolerance across distributed intelligent agents.\nIn addition, the A2A protocol explicitly addresses the asynchronous nature of agent communication,\nintroducing mechanisms for asynchronous messaging and task state updates. Once a client agent\nhas initiated a task, it can subscribe to receive progress updates relating to that task. As the task\nprogresses, any status changes are promptly sent to the client agent, ensuring users are kept informed\nin real time.\nThe A2A protocol achieves cross-task, multi-turn, and cross-agent context consistency tracking\nthrough its context identification and tightly coupled task–message binding mechanisms. This en-\nsures a high degree of coordination between information and task flows in multi-agent systems. Fur-\nthermore, the protocol incorporates specific design considerations to support asynchronous agent\ncommunication and task progress updates. These features provide a robust foundation for the\nAgentic Web, enabling effective context management and supporting long-duration, multi-stage,\nand asynchronous task execution.\n5.4 Emerging Directions of Agentic Web Systems\nHaving detailed the systematic transitions of the Agentic Web, from its foundational architecture to"}

We will explore two fundamental challenges that arise directly from the previously discussed\ntransformations: the disruption of the traditional user-browser relationship and the unresolved com-\nplexity of creating sustainable billing models for agentic services. Answering these questions is\ncrucial to connect architectural principles with their real-world implementation.\n5.4.1 The Disruption of Traditional Browsers by Agents\nThe emergence of the “agent browser” signifies a fundamental disruption to the established user-\nbrowser interaction paradigm that has dominated the web for decades. Traditional browsers function\nas passive, user-driven tools for information retrieval and direct manipulation; the user is in complete\ncontrol, manually clicking links, filling forms, and navigating pages. In stark contrast, an agent\nbrowser operates as a proactive, goal-oriented partner. It accepts high-level objectives in natural\nlanguage and autonomously translates them into a series of actions, fundamentally altering the user’s\nrole from a hands-on operator to a strategic delegator.\nThis shift from direct manipulation to delegated autonomy raises profound questions about inter-\nface design, user control, and trust. How can we design user interfaces that effectively manage user\nexpectations when the execution path is no longer linear or predictable, but is instead a dynamic\nprocess decided by the agent? When a user delegates a complex task, the agent’s reasoning process\ncan become a “black box,” creating a potential gap in user understanding and trust. What new\ninteraction primitives are required to allow for meaningful human oversight, intervention, and col-\nlaboration without undermining the agent’s autonomy? What methods are effective for shaping a\nuser’s mental model to precisely represent the functionalities and restrictions of the agent, ensuring\nthey can delegate tasks effectively and safely? Ultimately, the central question is how we rede-\nfine the user’s relationship with the browser when it evolves from a simple tool into an intelligent,\nautonomous partner.\n5.4.2 The Billing Challenge for Advanced Agent Services\nBeyond the challenges in user interaction, the practical and widespread adoption of advanced agent\nsystems confronts a critical hurdle: the development of viable and transparent billing models. Unlike\ntraditional software with predictable, often flat-rate pricing (e.g., subscriptions), advanced agent\ntasks, such as conducting a deep investigative report, generating complex images, or executing multi-\nstep financial analyses, incur variable and potentially substantial computational costs. These costs\nstem from resource-intensive operations, including extensive LLM token consumption, numerous\nthird-party API calls, and prolonged use of high-performance computing infrastructure.\nThis variability raises a central, unresolved question: how can we design a billing system that is\nboth equitable for the user and sustainable for the service provider? The traditional “one-size-fits-\nall” subscription model appears inadequate for this new reality. How can resource consumption\nbe accurately tracked and attributed back to a single high-level user command, especially when\nthat command spawns multiple sub-agents that may collaborate and delegate tasks further? What\nmechanisms can be implemented to provide users with a reliable cost estimatebefore initiating a\npotentially expensive task, thereby preventing “bill shock” and fostering trust? Should billing be\nbased on consumed resources (e.g., tokens, CPU time), the value of the final outcome, or a more\ncomplex hybrid model? Devising a framework that is granular, transparent, and user-friendly is a\nformidable challenge that will directly impact the economic feasibility and accessibility of the entire\nagent ecosystem.\n6 Applications of the Agentic Web"}

It facilitates three core functional paradigms,\ntransactional, informational, and communicational, which allow agents to autonomously execute\ntasks, process and reason over knowledge, and collaborate with other agents within digital envi-\nronments. By providing machine readable interfaces, persistent cross-platform memory, and stan-\ndardized coordination protocols, the Agentic Web transforms these paradigms from isolated agent\nbehaviors into scalable, system-wide capabilities.\n• Transactional: Agents autonomously execute goal-oriented tasks on behalf of users or or-\nganizations, such as purchasing, booking, scheduling, or negotiating, by interfacing directly\nwith web services, APIs, or transactional interfaces.\n• Informational: Agents retrieve, synthesize, and contextualize information across dynamic\nsources. This modality supports research, knowledge discovery, monitoring, and real-time\ndecision support through adaptive reasoning and long-horizon memory.\n• Communicational: Agents engage in structured communication with other agents or sys-\ntems to coordinate, delegate, or cocreate. This includes multi-agent negotiation, protocol\nalignment, and collaborative workflows across organizational or platform boundaries.\nThese modalities represent distinct ways in which agents interact with digital environments, whether\nby executing tasks, gathering and analyzing knowledge, or coordinating with other agents. The inte-\ngration of these modalities into real-world applications highlights the transformative potential of the\nAgentic Web. Most applications of the Agentic Web span multiple modalities, with specific systems\nemphasizing different functional combinations. The following sections will analyze representative\nimplementations and domain-specific use cases from this perspective, incorporating insights from\nrecent research.\n6.1.1 Transactional: Enabling Autonomous Execution of Web-Based Services\nThe Agentic Web redefines how transactional interactions are conducted by embedding LLM-\npowered agents directly into service infrastructures (Zhou et al., 2023b; Deng et al., 2023). With\nthe help of semantic APIs, standardized execution protocols, and persistent authorization tokens,\nagents can interact with multiple service endpoints without requiring bespoke integrations (Master-\nman et al., 2024).\nThis framework enables agents to autonomously orchestrate complex, multi-step workflows. For\nexample, booking a trip no longer requires users to manually navigate several websites. Instead,\nan agent within the Agentic Web can query multiple travel providers, assess options based on\nfactors such as price, time, loyalty status, or environmental impact, and complete the bookings\nsimultaneously by coordinating flights, accommodations, and car rentals in one seamless operation.\nSimilarly, App/Mobile Agents (Wang et al., 2024a; Wu et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a) enhance\nthe Agentic Web’s transactional capabilities by providing personalized, context-aware services across\ndevices. App/Mobile Agents can autonomously handle tasks such as managing a user’s calendar,\nadjusting schedules, and coordinating tasks based on real-time information. For instance, when\nbooking a flight, a Mobile Agent could automatically adjust the user’s itinerary if a flight is delayed,\nsuggest meal options based on dietary preferences, or even reorder tickets if there is a sudden\nchange in plans. These agents operate across mobile platforms, facilitating the seamless execution"}

Rather than merely retrieving data, agents within the Agentic Web\nare empowered to perform end-to-end research tasks, identifying, contextualizing, and synthesizing\ninformation over extended periods (Opera, 2025; Corporation, 2025).\nIn this model, agents go beyond simple search queries and static responses. Utilizing standard-\nized document schemas, citation graphs, and persistent monitoring capabilities, agents can perform\ncomprehensive, longitudinal research. For example, Deepresearch Agents (Huang et al., 2025b) au-\ntonomouslytrackemergingpapers, comparemethodologies, extractcitations, andsynthesizefindings\ninto structured outputs. These agents continuously refine their insights based on the latest publica-\ntions, leveraging the Agentic Web’s ability to facilitate cross-platform collaboration and seamlessly\nintegrate new data sources. This allows Deepresearch Agents to operate as active participants in a\nbroader, interconnected research ecosystem, where knowledge is continuously updated and refined.\nThe Agentic Web facilitates this by providing a unified infrastructure where agents are not only\ncapable of reading and writing data but also reasoning, negotiating, and acting within a dynamic\nand evolving environment. Deepresearch Agents are designed to assist researchers in navigating\nthe vast and ever-evolving landscape of academic literature, and they do this by leveraging the\nAgentic Web’s capabilities for cross-platform memory and semantic interoperability. These agents\nautonomously identify gaps in research, suggest new directions, and propose potential collaborators\nbased on shared interests, making the research process more efficient and comprehensive.\nIn practice, Deepresearch Agents automate the synthesis of large datasets, identifying patterns and\ntrends across a wide range of publications. This process is made scalable by the Agentic Web’s\nability to support inter-agent communication, where these agents can collaborate, share findings,\nand even align their goals with other agents working across different domains. By doing so, the\nAgentic Web transforms research from isolated, manual efforts into a collaborative, scalable system\nof knowledge discovery.\n6.1.3 Communicational: Orchestrating Inter-Agent Collaboration and Negotiation\nPerhaps the most distinct departure from today’s web lies in the Agentic Web’s capacity to support\nautonomous, goal-driven communication between agents. This capability is not limited to message\npassing; it also encompasses semantic alignment, negotiation, delegation, and long-term coordination\nacross agents that represent different users, systems, or organizations.\nIn a communicational paradigm, agents function as active participants in multi-agent workflows\n(Tran et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2023b). Consider a joint research initiative spanning multiple univer-\nsities: agents representing each institution can autonomously share relevant datasets, align experi-\nmentaltimelines, andcoauthorreports, negotiatingauthorship, fundingdistribution, andintellectual\nproperty rights based on prespecified protocols (Anthropic, 2024a).\nCreative industries benefit similarly.

The former focuses on augmenting the user experience by providing intelligent\nintermediaries between humans and the web, while the latter introduces autonomous agents that\nact on behalf of the user, interacting with web systems directly as proxy users.\n6.2.1 Agent-as-Interface: Agents as Intelligent Web Intermediaries\nIn theAgent-as-Interfaceparadigm, agents enhance traditional user interfaces by providing context-\naware assistance, task recommendations, and intelligent summarization. These systems typically\noperate alongside the human user, augmenting their browsing experience without fully automating\ndecision-making. Representative applications are summarized in Table 2.\nOpera Neon delivers one of the most integrated experiences of agent-enhanced browsing. Re-\nleased in May 2025, it features a tri-modal interface:Chat enables conversational interaction with\nLLMs, Do facilitates autonomous completion of web tasks such as multi-step forms and service work-\nflows, andMake empowers content creation and persistent agent tasks even when users are offline\n(Opera, 2025; Press, 2025). Notably, Opera Neon’s “Do” mode represents ahybrid approach,\nwhere the system transitions from interface augmentation to autonomous user proxy behavior,\ndemonstrating how Agent-as-Interface applications can incorporate Agent-as-User capabilities while\n38"}

This design reduces context-switching overhead and improves session continuity, highlighting\nthe benefits of embedded, contextually aware agents.\nMicrosoft Copilot focuses on summarization and lightweight agentic assistance via a non-\nintrusive sidebar, targeting everyday users who benefit from summarizations, insights, and task\nhints but do not require full task automation (Corporation, 2025).\nMicrosoft NLWeb advances the notion ofAgent-Native Interfaces, proposing a semantic layer for\nwebsites where agents interact through natural language interfaces exposed via schemas and MCP\n(Microsoft Corporate Blogs, 2025). By encouraging publishers to design agent-accessible endpoints,\nNLWeb shifts the web ecosystem towards cooperative interaction between websites and AI agents,\nreducing reliance on brittle scraping and improving transparency in web automation.\n6.2.2 Agent-as-User: Autonomous Agents Operating as Proxies\nIn the Agent-as-User paradigm, AI systems operate autonomously as users of the web, executing\ntasks, navigating interfaces, and completing workflows without direct human control. These systems\nleverage browser automation, virtual environments, and programmatic UI manipulation to emulate\nuser actions, thereby enabling end-to-end autonomy. The development and evaluation of such agents\nhave been greatlyfacilitatedbycomprehensivebenchmarks likeMind2Web(Denget al.,2023), which\nincludes over 2,000 open-ended tasks across 137 websites in 31 domains. Its online extension, Online-\nMind2Web (Xue et al., 2025), further advances this effort by offering 300 diverse and realistic tasks\nacross 136 websites, enabling the assessment of web agents under conditions that closely mirror\nreal-world usage patterns. Recent advances in multimodal agent foundations (Wu et al., 2025) and\nmobileagentarchitectures(Wangetal.,2024a)havefurtherexpandedthescopeofautonomousagent\ncapabilities beyond traditional web environments, while scalable task generation methodologies (Xie\net al., 2025) advance the field’s evaluation capabilities. Examples of recent applications are shown\nin Table 3.\nChatGPT Agent (evolved from OpenAI Operator), released via the ChatGPT platform, repre-\nsents one of the first multi-modal agentic deployments with persistent virtual browsing capabilities.\nCombining LLM reasoning with code execution, file system access, and API integrations, the Agent\ncan autonomously complete multi-step tasks such as booking services, extracting structured data, or\nsynthesizing reports across complex web workflows. Initially launched as Operator in January 2025,\nit has since been fully integrated into ChatGPT’s core platform as “Agent Mode” demonstrating\nthe rapid evolution from standalone research prototypes to integrated production systems (OpenAI,\n2025).\nAnthropic Computer Use leverages vision-based perception and GUI manipulation, powered\nby Claude models, to control desktop and web interfaces in a human-like fashion without relying on\nbackend APIs.

This evolution is driven\nby fundamental differences in their underlying technical architectures. Agent-as-Interface systems\nprimarily rely onAPI-based interactions, utilizing structured endpoints, webhooks, and service\nintegrations to mediate between users and web services.

While this approach provides universal compatibility and can operate on\nany visual interface, it introduces latency, brittleness, and higher computational overhead due to the\nneed for continuous visual interpretation and coordinate calculation.\nThe convergence toward hybrid architectures suggests a future where agents dynamically select\nbetween API calls for structured interactions and GUI automation for legacy or non-API-enabled\nsystems.

Such\nsystems will likely require sophisticated decision trees to determine the optimal interaction method\nfor each specific workflow component, building upon advances in multimodal agent foundations (Wu\netal.,2025)andenhancedbydeepresearchcapabilities(Huangetal.,2025b)forcomplexinformation\nsynthesis tasks.\nIn summary, early applications of the Agentic Web demonstrate a spectrum of possibilities from\nAgent-as-Interface augmentation to Agent-as-User autonomy, with an emerging trend toward hy-\nbrid implementations. The convergence of commercial products and academic research suggests\naccelerating momentum toward more capable, accountable, and architecturally flexible web agents\nthat can adapt their interaction strategies to maximize both efficiency and reliability.\n6.2.3 Agent-with-Physics: Autonomous Robots Powered by AI Agents\nThe Agent-with-Physics paradigm extends the concept of agentic intelligence from the virtual realm\nto the physical world, enabling AI agents to perceive, reason, and act through embodied systems\nsuch as robots and sensor-equipped devices. These agents integrate high-level planning with low-level\ncontrol, often relying on multimodal perception (e.g., vision, audio, haptics), real-time adaptation,\nand embodied cognition to execute physical tasks autonomously in dynamic environments.\nUnlike purely digital agents, Agent-with-Physics systems must address challenges related to safety,\nlatency, actuation uncertainty, and physical affordances. Recent advances in vision-language-action\nmodels (Kim et al., 2024; Geng et al., 2025; Li et al., 2023), hierarchical policy learning (NVIDIA\net al., 2025; Kuang et al., 2024; Geng et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2024), and real-world training\nenvironments, such as Open X-Embodiment (O’Neill et al., 2023), have significantly improved the\ngeneralization capabilities of robotic agents across diverse tasks, from household manipulation to\nwarehouse logistics.\nRepresentativeimplementationssuchasRT-1(Brohanetal.,2023b), RT-2(Brohanetal.,2023a)and\nRT-X (O’Neill et al., 2023), Tesla Optimus, and Figure 01 showcase emerging commercial interest\nin general-purpose humanoid robots, while academic efforts like PaLM-E (Driess et al., 2023) and\nMobile ALOHA (Fu et al., 2024) highlight the integration of large foundation models into robotic\ncontrol loops. These systems demonstrate the feasibility of using language prompts to guide physical\nbehavior, bridging human intent and machine execution through a unified agentic framework.\nAs embodied agents increasingly connect with digital ecosystems, a new class of hybrid agents\nemerges, capable of coordinating actions both online and offline. For instance, an agent might\nautonomously schedule a grocery delivery online while simultaneously preparing a physical environ-\nment (e.g., setting up a smart kitchen) for the incoming goods. This tight coupling of perception,\ncognition, and actuation highlights the importance of developing robust control policies, real-time\nfeedback loops, and safety-aware planning strategies.\nLooking ahead, the Agent-with-Physics paradigm not only expands the frontier of human-agent\ncollaboration but also lays the groundwork for a unified agentic infrastructure where digital and\nphysical agents operate in concert. The fusion of web-native intelligence, embodied autonomy, and\nmultimodal interaction marks a critical step toward realizing truly general-purpose AI agents capable\nof seamlessly bridging virtual tasks and physical realities.\n7 Risks, Security & Governance\nIn this section, we provide an overview of how agentic web safety and security can be ensured.\nAs illustrated in Figure 13, the ecosystem of Agentic Web Safety and Security is composed of"}

These cascades transform localized attacks into system-wide failures (de Witt,\n2025). For instance, a goal drift (C1) can lead to protocol exploitation (P1), ultimately resulting\nin unauthorized purchases (E1). The temporal dimension adds further complexity as threats can\npersist across agent generations through learned behaviors and contaminated training data.\nRelationship to Existing Frameworks While OWASP’s Agentic AI Threat Model (OWASP\nGenAI Security Project, 2025) and CSA’s MAESTRO framework (Huang, 2025) provide founda-\ntional vulnerability taxonomies, Agentic Web threats differ in scale and propagation. For instance,\nour Knowledge Base Poisoning (C2) extends beyond prompt injection to web-scale information cor-\nruption, as demonstrated by code review agent compromises (CyberArk Labs, 2025).\nProtocol threats adapt traditional network security to agent-specific contexts. MCP Context In-\njection (P1) exploits the protocol’s contextual awareness, which is identified as a fundamental vul-\nnerability by Hou et al. (2025) and demonstrated practically by Attiya (2025).

A critical challenge in\nthis sphere is ensuring agents consider their impact on multiple stakeholders. Mitigation strategies\ncould draw from concepts such as simulating accountability and assessing stakeholder impact, though\nscaling these alignment mechanisms remains an open challenge (Sel et al., 2024).\n7.1.2 Security Implications and Future Directions\nAgentic Web security requires three fundamental shifts from traditional approaches:\n1. Architecture: Zero-trust models replacing perimeter security\n2. Policies: Adaptive defenses superseding static rules\n3. Scope: Cascade prevention over incident isolation\nEnterprise patterns like MCP require adaptation for internet-scale deployments (Narajala and\nHabler, 2025), as traditional models assume bounded, stateless operations incompatible with persis-\ntent web agents.\nCritical research gaps persist. Quantitative models for cascade probability and impact remain un-\nderdeveloped, particularly for emergent behaviors in complex multi-agent systems (de Witt, 2025).\nThe challenge of securing systems that learn and adapt continuously has been recognized in recent\nwork on evolving threat landscapes (Deng et al., 2025), while cross-jurisdictional governance poses\nadditional complexity (Brundage et al., 2018). These dynamic threats may require fundamentally\nnew security paradigms. Rather than static defenses that become obsolete, future approaches might\nembrace adaptability as a core principle: designing systems that strengthen through controlled ad-\nversarial exposure (Jin and Lee, 2025).

Forexample,\none significant agentic web risk that may lead to information leakage is hallucination, where agents\ngenerate inaccurate or misleading content due to limited understanding of user intent or contextual\nambiguity during retrieval and generation. Another critical risk is permission escalation: when\nagents access sensitive user data, such as personal files (e.g., user name, password, and contacts),\nthey may misinterpret access boundaries or inadvertently override security constraints when the\nagent manages different web pages. These failures can result in unauthorized data exposure, privacy\nviolations, and broader system-level vulnerabilities in the agentic web.\nTo mitigate these risks, red-teaming techniques are promising approaches to ensure the safety and\nsecurity of agentic web systems prior to real-world deployment. Red teaming has a long history\nin domains such as computer system security and military defense simulation, where it is used to\nidentify vulnerabilities and evaluate system robustness (Verma et al., 2024). Red teaming involves\nsimulating adversarial behavior to uncover vulnerabilities in a target system, traditionally performed\nthrough manual human design. Specifically, in traditional computer system safety and security, red\nteaming often involves manual human effort, expert-defined rules, and extensive scenario testing\n(Röttger et al., 2020; Ribeiro et al., 2020). In the era of AI-driven agentic web systems, red teaming\ncan be largely automated, with AI agents autonomously generating adversarial scenarios to probe\nand uncover failure modes in other agentic systems (Wang et al., 2025c). These target systems\nmay include various web platforms and pages, where the primary objective is to expose sensitive\ninformation leaks and reveal potential vulnerabilities, ultimately enhancing system trustworthiness\nand security before real-world deployment. This automation reduces reliance on manual efforts and\nenables scalable, adaptive adversarial evaluation (Perez et al., 2022; Ge et al., 2023; He et al., 2025).\n7.2.1 Human-Involved Red Teaming\nHuman involvement has played a vital role in red-teaming efforts across diverse NLP tasks (Xu\net al., 2020; Glaese et al., 2022; Radharapu et al., 2023), and these techniques can also be leveraged\nto enhance the safety and security of agentic web systems. For example, adversarial examples have\nbeen manually crafted to evaluate machine reading comprehension systems (Jia and Liang, 2017).\nHuman annotations have been used to assess unintended bias in text classification (Dixon et al.,\n2018) and to support fairness and robustness evaluation through counterfactual data generation\n45"}

In multi-hop question answering, human-labeled examples have helped evaluate\ncomplex reasoning capabilities (Jiang and Bansal, 2019).\nHuman-in-the-loop frameworks have also been employed to generate adversarial attacks targeting\ndialogue safety (Dinan et al., 2019) and to improve robustness in language understanding tasks (Nie\net al., 2019). Additionally, human-curated adversarial training datasets have been shown to enhance\nmodel performance (Wallace et al., 2021), particularly in high-stakes, reliability-critical settings\n(Ziegler et al., 2022). Manual red-teaming efforts have also been applied in the development of\nLLaMA models (Touvron et al., 2023a), where human annotators carefully design prompts to surface\nunsafe behaviors in large language models. Kiela et al. (2021) further propose a human-in-the-\nloop framework for dynamic adversarial testing via a web-based platform, enabling the continuous\ncollectionofadversarialexamplesfromhumanannotators. Throughthisiterativeprocess, modelsare\nexposed to increasingly challenging examples, leading to improved robustness over time. However,\napplying these human-involved techniques to agentic web environments presents new challenges.\nAgentic web systems are highly autonomous and capable of operating across a variety of web pages\nand platforms. This level of complexity and intelligence makes manual red-teaming less feasible and\nhighlights the need for scalable, automated approaches.\nInthecontextoftheagenticweb, whereautonomousAIagentsinteractwithcomplex, multi-platform\nenvironments on behalf of users, automated red teaming is becoming increasingly essential. Tradi-\ntional human-in-the-loop approaches, such as designing security rules, labeling safety violations, or\nmanually identifying vulnerabilities, struggle to scale in these dynamic, high-autonomy systems. For\ninstance, safeguarding AI agents that navigate ticketing platforms, manage financial transactions, or\noperate across multiple web services requires real-time, adaptive evaluation that manual red teaming\ncannot sustain. Automated red teaming offers a scalable solution by enabling agents to simulate\nadversarial behaviors, uncover hidden safety flaws, and proactively report security risks, helping to\nensure agentic web safety before real-world deployment.\n7.2.2 Automatic Red Teaming\nRecent work has increasingly explored the use of LLMs for automated red teaming (Perez et al.,\n2022; Ge et al., 2023; Nie et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b; Shi et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025c; He\net al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b), which holds particular promise for enhancing safety in agentic web\nsystems. For instance, Perez et al. (2022) show that LLMs can serve as effective red teamers by\ngenerating adversarial prompts to uncover unsafe behaviors. Similarly, Ge et al. (2023) introduce\nMART, which is an automatic red teaming framework and is designed to evaluate and enhance\nthe safety of LLMs through adversarial scenario generation. Ganguli et al. (2022) explore various\nstrategies for red-teaming, including rejection sampling and RL, and release a dataset to support\nthis research. Their findings suggest that RL-based approaches can make systems more resistant to\nred-teaming attacks by hardening decision boundaries and improving robustness.\nBuilding on this line of work, Nie et al. (2024) propose a RL-based red teaming approach that\ntrains an adversarial agent using a carefully designed reward function to generate diverse adversar-\nial examples, effectively revealing vulnerabilities in target LLMs. Their comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that this method performs better than strong baselines in exposing model information\nleakage. Similarly, Wang et al.

Likewise, Yang et al. (2024) propose an agent-based\nbackdoor attacker for red teaming LLM agents, focusing on web-based shopping systems where pri-\nvacy leakage is a critical concern. In a related line of work, Xu et al. (2024b) introduce a data\npoisoning technique that injects backdoors through instruction attacks, demonstrating that even a\nfew malicious tokens during instruction tuning can compromise model safety and expose critical vul-\nnerabilities. This approach highlights the risks associated with instruction-based inputs and offers\na valuable method for red teaming to uncover hidden weaknesses in language models.\nRed teaming often involves multi-agent systems in the agentic web, where agents play both offensive\nand defensive roles. For that multi-agent techniques, Shi et al. (2024) utilize LLM-based agents\nto generate adversarial inputs through word substitutions and sentence rephrasings, targeting the\nrobustness of LLM detection systems. In a more systemic approach, He et al. (2025) introduce a\nmulti-agent red teaming framework in which LLMs act as adversarial agents to probe vulnerabilities,\nparticularly in inter-agent communication protocols. Expanding the scope of automated evaluation,\nRadharapu et al. (2023) develop AI-assisted red teaming methods that extend across a broad range\nof applications, including policy evaluation and locale-specific challenges. In addition, AutoDan (Liu\net al., 2024b) and AutoDan-Turbo (Liu et al., 2025c) present scalable and adaptive frameworks for\nautomated red teaming, pushing the boundaries of adversarial testing for LLM-based system safety\nand security.\nLLM-driven automatic red teaming represents a promising future research direction for safety and\nsecurity, particularly within the context of the agentic web. These models can systematically simu-\nlate human behaviors and comprehensively probe safety and security vulnerabilities across various\nscenarios. However, to fully realize their potential, it is critical to design robust frameworks for\nmanaging these red-teaming agents in agentic web systems. These frameworks are crucial for both\neffective evaluation and defense, as well as for guaranteeing the safety of agentic web systems. This is\nespecially important in real-world applications, such as when agents are used to book travel, interact\nwith various apps and web pages, or manage tasks across personal computers and mobile devices.\n7.2.3 Emerging Directions in Red Teaming for Agentic Web\nAs mentioned above, red teaming plays a critical role in identifying and mitigating safety risks in\nagentic web systems and LLMs prior to real-world deployment. Human-involved red teaming pro-\nvides domain expertise and high reliability for specific tasks, making it a valuable tool for ensuring\nsafety and security. However, it is often costly, time-consuming, and limited in diversity and scala-\nbility (Radharapu et al., 2023).

Such compromises can mislead the\nevaluation process and result in the leakage of sensitive or private data from the underlying\nsystems, undermining both safety and trustworthiness.\n• Emergent Misalignment in Agentic Web Agents:As language models scale and op-\nerate over longer contexts in real-time web environments, red-teaming techniques may fail\nto detect novel and complex failure modes. A key risk is unauthorized goal generalization,\nwhere LLM-driven agents pursue objectives beyond their intended scope, such as executing\nunintended actions on web services, due to misaligned reasoning during test-time interac-\ntions. This poses critical safety and security risks for open-ended, autonomous agentic web\napplications.\nAddressing these emerging challenges in agentic web safety and security requires interdisciplinary\ncollaboration across red teaming methodologies, agent alignment strategies, evaluation frameworks,\nand robust deployment protocols.\n7.3 Safety and Security Defense\nThe above subsection has discussed approaches that could identify potential threats or vulnerabilities\nofLLMagentsduringtheirdevelopmentstages. Inthissubsection, wewillfocusondefensiveresearch\nefforts that can further mitigate the safety issues of these agents at deployment. Specifically, we\nwill discuss recent approaches that leverage external models for threat mitigation (i.e. guardrails),\nand approaches that steer LLM agents towards safer generation or planning. We will further discuss\nseveral emergent challenges in this context.\n7.3.1 Inference-time Guardrails\nThe recent proliferation of LLMs has sparked growing interest in the development of guardrails,\nwhich serve as external safety mechanisms designed to identify and mitigate potentially harmful\ninputs or outputs of LLMs (Markov et al., 2023; Inan et al., 2023; Chi et al., 2024; Han et al.,\n2024). These guardrails have attracted attention due to their adaptability across different LLM\nimplementations and their effectiveness in risk mitigation.\nEarlier guardrails developed prior to the emergence of agentic AI primarily framed content mod-\neration as a discriminative task, wherein a model classifies inputs (and sometimes also outputs) of\nLLMs as either safe or unsafe, or categorizes them into specific classes of harmful content (Wen\net al., 2025). Initial approaches to guardrails relied heavily on rule-based filtering techniques (Welbl\net al., 2021; Clarke et al., 2023; Gómez et al., 2024) that utilize predefined lexicons or heuristic\nrules to identify potentially unsafe content. While these rule-based methods offer transparency and\ncomputational efficiency, they inherently lack flexibility and generalization capabilities. Subsequent\nstudies have transitioned towards model-based guardrails, leveraging supervised fine-tuning on cu-\nrated safety datasets to enhance content classification in alignment with predefined safety policies.\nRepresentative open-source examples in this category include LLaMA Guard (Inan et al., 2023; Fe-\ndorov et al., 2024; Chi et al., 2024), NeMo Guardrails (Rebedea et al., 2023) and Aegis Guard (Ghosh\net al., 2024).\nToadvance LLMguardrailstowardmoreagenticcapabilities, twokey developmentsare essential: the\nintegration of deliberative reasoning and lifelong learnability.

Lifelong\nlearnability allows systems to adapt continuously to new information, evolving norms, and edge\ncases over time. Together, these capabilities form the foundation for more robust, context-sensitive\nguardrails that go beyond static filters to support safe and reliable autonomous behavior. In the\nfollowing, we discuss recent studies on these two key lines of development.\nReasoning Guardrails. As a critical but very recent advancement of guardrails, reasoning\nguardrails assess the intent, context, and possible risks associated with LLMs’ inputs and outputs\nthrough structured reasoning, instead of conduct fast-thinking to merely predict threat labels like\nprevious static guardrails.\nAs one of the very first reasoning guardrails, ThinkGuard (Wen et al., 2025) draws inspiration from\ncognitive theories that differentiate fast and slow modes of human thinking (Hagendorff et al., 2022;\nMinetal.,2024). Inthiscontext, fastthinkingtypicallyresultsinsuperficialorincorrectassessments,\nmaking models susceptible to adversarial manipulation, whereas deliberative reasoning mitigates\nthese vulnerabilities by facilitating more robust and contextually informed decisions (Lin et al.,\n2024a). To train guardrails capable of deliberative reasoning, ThinkGuard utilizes mission-focused\ndistillation (Zhou et al., 2024) extracting structured reasoning supervision from existing LLMs to\ngenerate augmented safety datasets with reasoning critiques. Deliberative reasoning is integrated\ninto the guardrail through a two-stage conversational fine-tuning procedure: the first stage outputs\nan initial prediction, followed by a second stage that articulates the underlying reasoning. This\nmechanism allows for the efficiency of traditional LLM-based guardrails if reasoning generation is opt\nout while retaining interpretability when needed. As a contemporaneous work, GuardReasoner (Liu\net al., 2025d) also devise a similar process to augment safety supervision data with distillation,\nwhile its training has two differences: it conducts RL to finetune the guardrail model, but does not\nlearn an optional latent reasoning mode as ThinkGuard. Based on the methodology exemplified by\nThinkGuard and GuardReasoner, more recent efforts have further extended reasoning guardrails to\nmultimodal (Liu et al., 2025e) and multilingual (Yang et al., 2025b) scenarios.\nTo summarize, developing the reasoning guardrail models is a prerequisite to realizing Agentic\nGuardrails because agentic behavior involves multi-step planning and decision-making that cannot\nbe reliably constrained by surface-level filters or static rules. Reasoning Guardrails enable structured\noversight of an agent’s internal deliberations, allowing alignment interventions at the level of goals,\nplans, and justifications.\nAgentic Guardrails. In contrast to the aforementioned reasoning guardrails, agentic guardrails\noperate at the level of action execution, overseeing or constraining how an agent interacts with\nexternal systems or environments. While reasoning guardrails shape what the agent thinks and\ntells, agentic guardrails govern what the agent does.\nDeveloping agent guardrails presents a range of challenges spanning both technical and contextual\ndimensions.

Central to its approach is a memory-based mechanism that stores and\nreuses past unsafe trajectories and guardrail refinements, enabling lifelong learnability and continual\nimprovement. It combines adaptive safety-check synthesis with iterative refinement using cooper-\native LLMs and supports tool-assisted validation, allowing it to address both task-specific (e.g.,\nprompt injection) and environmental threats. AGrail demonstrates strong cross-task generalization\nand effective integration with various LLM-based agents. LlamaFirewall (Chennabasappa et al.,\n2025) is a modular, open-source framework designed to secure LLM agents through a combination\nof real-time defenses. It integrates a fine-tuned BERT-style model for jailbreak and prompt-injection\ndetection, a preliminary auditor leveraging few-shot chain-of-thought prompting for reasoning, and\nan online system tailored for LLM-generated programs for static analysis of generated code. The\nsystem achieves strong security performance with minimal utility loss and is built to be extensible\nacross diverse agent applications. Meanwhile, GuardAgent (Xiang et al., 2025) dynamically moni-\ntors and enforces user-defined safety or privacy policies by translating guard requests into executable\ncode through a two-step process of task planning and code generation. It leverages a memory-based\nin-context demonstration mechanism that retrieves past examples at each step to enhance its rea-\nsoning and support lifelong learnability and adaptability.\n7.3.2 Controllable Generation and Planning\nIn addition to leveraging external guardrail components, other research efforts investigate control-\nlable generation to steer LLM agents towards safer generation or planning at inference. In this\ncontext, we categorize these efforts into safe decoding approaches, and approaches for agentic access\ncontrol.\nSafe decoding approaches typically incorporate constrained decoding or decoding processes guided\nby a safety reward to achieve their goals. For example, SafeDecoding (Xu et al., 2024c) leverages\nthe insight that even under attack the model still assigns non-trivial probability to safe tokens, and\ndynamically reshapes the token distribution at each decoding step to prioritize harmless outputs.\nSafePlanner (Li et al., 2025b) introduces a framework that enhances safety awareness in LLM agents\nfor robot task planning. It incorporates a safety prediction module trained in a simulator, which\nguides the high-level planner to make safe and executable decisions. Thought-Aligner (Jiang et al.,\n2025) is a lightweight, plug-in safety module designed to enhance the behavioral safety of LLM-based\nagents by dynamically correcting high-risk reasoning steps before action execution. It operates by\nfine-tuning a contrastive learning model on a dataset of safe and unsafe thought pairs, enabling\nreal-time thought correction with extremely low latency.\nAccess control remains an underexplored area in current research. Progent (Shi et al., 2025) in-\ntroduces the first comprehensive privilege-control mechanism designed specifically for LLM-based\nagents, enforcing the principle of least privilege during tool invocation. It centers around a domain-\nspecific policy language that allows developers and users to specify fine-grained constraints on when\ntools may be invoked and define fallback behaviors for blocked actions. This policy-driven model\nenforces the principle of least privilege, ensuring agents only perform tool operations essential to the\ntask at hand. Its modular architecture enables seamless integration into existing agent systems with\nminimal code modifications and without altering the agent’s internal logic. To lower the burden on\nusers, Progent also supports automated policy generation and updates, leveraging LLMs themselves\nto craft and adapt these privilege policies dynamically in response to evolving user queries.

Such a framework offers a promising direction for enhancing safety in\nLLM-based agents. By conditioning access on user identity, intent, or role, it enables finer-grained,\ncontext-sensitive safeguards. Furthermore, its capacity to regulate internal knowledge usage rather\nthan just output filtering allows deeper integration into agent reasoning and planning workflows.\n7.3.3 Emerging Directions in Defense for Agentic Web\nThreat mitigation for agents after their deployment is so far a preliminary area of study. Beyond\nthe current prototypes in existing preliminary studies, and there are quite a few emergent challenges\ntowards truly generalizable and reliable approaches, for which we briefly discuss a selected set of\nthem as follows.\n• Efficiency: Asdiscussed, thereasoning-basedparadigmnodoubtstrengthenstheguardrails\nin terms of robustness and interpretability. Yet, it inevitably introduces more inference\noverhead in comparison to previous fast-thinking or discriminative guardrails. While a few\ncurrent reasoning guardrails such as ThinkGuard (Wen et al., 2025) have attempted to\nincorporate latent reasoning to some degrees, how to effectively compress the reasoning pro-\ncess and enhance the generation or retrieval of reasoning patterns for a real-time guardrail\nremains as a non-trivial challenge.\n• Generalizability: Generalizability is still a core challenge for Web agent safety because\nthese agents operate in open, unpredictable environments with constantly changing inter-\nfaces, tools, and tasks. Guardrails that work in training or on benchmarks often fail when\nagents encounter novel websites or instructions. Unsafe behavior can emerge from unfore-\nseen input combinations or even from new environments. Therefore, ensuring the robustness\nto diverse and evolving scenarios—not just effective in fixed settings as it is shown in many\nof the current experimental setups.\n• Certifiable defense: Certifiable and grounded defense is crucial for web agents because\nthey interact directly with external systems and users, where failures can lead to real-\nworld harm (e.g., sending emails, making purchases, or modifying files). Without grounded\nverification tied to the actual environment state (e.g., DOM structure, user intent, API\nconstraints), safety mechanisms may rely on incomplete or incorrect assumptions. Future\nresearch should develop safety mechanisms that are formally grounded in the web environ-\nment, such as DOM structures and API schemas, enabling agents to verify the safety of\ntheir actions before execution. It should also explore certifiable control and runtime verifi-\ncation techniques that ensure actions adhere to defined constraints, even under dynamic or\nadversarial conditions.\n7.4 Safety and Security Evaluation\nUnlike the relatively well-studied areas of traditional web safety (bt Mohd and Zaaba, 2019; Cox\netal.,2006), LLMsafetyevaluation(Yuanetal.,2024;2025), multimodalsafety(Xuetal.,2025), and\nrobot learning safety (Gu et al., 2023b), agentic web safety evaluation remains largely underexplored,\nwith only a few preliminary efforts proposed to date.\nOne recent work is SafeArena (Tur et al., 2025), which introduces a benchmark designed to assess\nthe misuse potential of LLM-based web agents. It evaluates agents on 250 safe and 250 harmful\ntasks across multiple harm categories, such as misinformation, cybercrime, and social bias, and tests\nmodels including ChatGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022; Achiam et al., 2023) and Qwen (Bai et al., 2023)\nto measure their compliance with malicious requests.\nAnother work is ST-WebAgentBench (Levy et al., 2024), which is an open-source benchmark for\nevaluating the safety and trustworthiness of autonomous web agents in enterprise-style tasks, built\non the WebArena environment. It defines six policy dimensions, user consent, preference satisfaction,\nscope boundaries, strict execution, robustness to distribution shifts, and error recovery, and adopts\n51"}

Similarly, AGrail (Luo et al., 2025) introduces Safe-OS, a realistic bench-\nmark designed to evaluate the safety of LLM-powered operating system agents under adversarial\nconditions. Comprised of three carefully curated attack scenarios, prompt injection, environment\nsabotage, and system-level exploitation, Safe-OS simulates real-world threats using Docker-based\nOS environments alongside benign operation logs. It complements evaluations on existing datasets\nfor operating system agents like Mind2Web-SC, EICU-AC (task-specific risks; Xiang et al. (2024)),\nAdvWeb (Xu et al., 2024a), and EIA (systemic risks; Liao et al. (2025)) to offer a comprehensive\nsafety assessment\nAgent-SafetyBench (Zhang et al., 2024b) provides a comprehensive safety evaluation framework with\n349 interaction environments and 2,000 test cases across eight safety risk categories. Notably, their\nevaluation reveals that no current agent achieves safety scores above 60%, highlighting fundamental\ndeficiencies in agent robustness and risk awareness. Complementing this, GuardAgent (Xiang et al.,\n2024) introduces a dynamic safety guardrail system that achieves 98% accuracy on safety-critical\ntasks through knowledge-enabled reasoning, while TrustAgent (Hua et al.) implements a three-\nstage safety strategy encompassing pre-planning knowledge injection, in-planning enhancement, and\npost-planning inspection.\nWhile benchmarks like SafeArena (Tur et al., 2025) and ST-WebAgentBench (Levy et al., 2024)\nprovide valuable insights into agentic web safety, further investigation is needed, particularly in\nareas such as multimodal agentic web safety and reasoning safety for agentic web agents.\n8 Challenges and Open Problems\nThe realization of the vision of Agentic Web, however, is contingent upon resolving a complex,\nmulti-dimensional set of challenges that span individual agent cognition, multi-agent coordination,\nhuman-agent alignment, systemic security, and socio-economic structures.\nThese challenges are not isolated technical hurdles but are deeply interconnected, forming a web of\ndependencies that must be addressed holistically. The problem of building the Agentic Web is not\nmerely about improving the capabilities of individual LLM or Agent but about architecting a new,\nreliable, and trustworthy computational layer atop the existing internet. The systemic nature of\nthese challenges is evident in how they cascade across domains. For instance, the technical need for\nagents to interact with the external world necessitates the creation of standardized communication\nprotocols, which have been likened to “HTTP for AI agents”. The existence of this new agent-native\narchitecture, in turn, creates new economic imperatives. The traditional advertising-based business\nmodel of the web is ill-suited for an agent-driven economy and is already showing signs of strain.\nThis necessitates new transactional models, but their viability depends directly on solving complex\nsecurity and trust issues surrounding autonomous payments. Thus, a technical challenge in one\narea, such as secure tool use, is inextricably linked to a socio-economic challenge in another, such\nas creating viable business models. A systems-thinking approach is therefore essential, recognizing\nthat a solution for one component may create or exacerbate problems elsewhere. The following table\nprovides a conceptual map of this complex problem space, categorizing the diverse challenges into\ncoherent themes that will be explored throughout this report.\n8.1 Foundational Challenges in Single-Agent Cognition and Autonomy\nBefore complex multi-agent and human-agent systems can be reliably constructed, the core cognitive\narchitecture of an individual agent must be made robust.

However, this\ncapability is deceptively brittle.\nThe Memory-Context Dilemma Memory is an essential architectural component for agentic\nsystems. Since LLMs are fundamentally stateless, they require external mechanisms to retain con-\nversation history, contextual information, and learned knowledge. Agentic architectures typically\nemploy both short-term memory to maintain coherence within a single task and long-term memory\nto carry knowledge across tasks. However, the management of this memory, especially in the face of\nfinite context windows and complex, long-horizon tasks, remains a primary bottleneck.\nThe Tool-Use Paradox The ability to use external tools, such as APIs, databases, calculators,\nand web search, is what transforms a passive LLM into an active agent capable of interacting with\nand affecting the real world. This is the primary mechanism for grounding an agent’s reasoning in\nactionable reality. However, this capability introduces a fundamental paradox: the every tools that\ngrant an agent real-world agency simultaneously represent its greatest vulnerability.\nThis creates a “Tool-Use Paradox”: to be effective, an agent must trust its tools to provide ac-\ncurate information and execute actions correctly; to be secure, it must assume any tool could be\ncompromised at any time. The resolution to this paradox lies in designing agents with an inherent\n“tool skepticism.” This requires moving to a zero-trust agent architecture where all external inputs,\nwhether from a user or a tool, are validated against a security policy. Previously, agent security\nfocused primarily on validating the user’s prompt. The existence of tool-initiated threats means the\nagent must also validate the tool’s response, creating a feedback loop of potential infection where a\nmalicious tool output could cause the agent to take another malicious action, leading to a cascading\nfailure. A secure agent cannot be a naive “tool-caller”; it must possess a security kernel or policy\nengine that scrutinizes all information crossing the boundary between its internal state and the\nexternal world. The open research question is how to build this skepticism without crippling the\nagent’s ability to act decisively based on tool outputs.\n8.2 The Learning Conundrum: From Static Models to Dynamic Learners\nWhile foundational models provide a powerful starting point, true agency requires the ability to\nlearn from experience, adapt to new environments, and continuously improve performance. This\nsection explores the profound challenges associated with transforming static, pre-trained models into\ndynamic, lifelong learners, focusing on the bottlenecks in RL, the threat of catastrophic forgetting,\nand the difficulties of grounding knowledge through interaction.\nReward Design Bottleneck RL is the primary paradigm for training agents to make optimal\nsequential decisions by interacting with an environment. It offers a path to move beyond the limi-\ntations of static, pattern-replicating LLMs, enabling them to handle ambiguity, maintain context in\nlong conversations, and balance competing objectives. However, the effectiveness of RL is critically\ndependent on the design of its reward function, which has become a major research bottleneck.\nThe Specter of Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning For agents to be truly\nautonomous and useful over long periods, they must be able to engage in continual, or lifelong,\nlearning: acquiring new knowledge and skills without overwriting or degrading previously learned\ncapabilities.

The success of the\nAgentic Web as a whole depends on the ability to orchestrate these multi-agent systems effectively,\na challenge that encompasses architectural design, communication standards, and the establishment\nof trust in decentralized environments.\nArchitectural Trade-offs: Hierarchical, Equi-level, and Nested Structures Multi-agent\nsystems can be organized into several distinct architectures, each with unique properties and chal-\nlenges. The primary structures identified in current research are equi-level (peer-to-peer), hierarchi-\ncal (leader-follower), and nested (hybrid systems of systems).\nThe Babel of Agents: The Imperative for Standardized Communication For a global\nAgentic Web to function, agents developed by different organizations on different platforms must be\nable to communicate and interoperate. Without common standards, the ecosystem would devolve\ninto a collection of isolated, proprietary “walled gardens,” akin to the pre-HTTP internet, stifling\ninnovation and collaboration.\nThe primary challenge is to develop and adopt standardized communication protocols that are\nexpressive enough to support complex agent interactions yet simple and open enough to foster\nwidespread adoption. This involves standardizing both the syntax (the format of messages) and\nthe semantics (the meaning of communicative acts, often based on speech act theory). Emerging\nstandards like IBM’s ACP and Google’s A2A for agent-to-agent communication and Anthropic’s\nMCP for agent-to-tool communication are designed to work in tandem to provide this foundational\nlayer. Major industry players are championing these open protocols, arguing that achieving ubiquity\nis more important than perfecting minor semantic differences, in order to create a truly open agentic\nweb.\nEstablishing Trust and Reputation in Decentralized EcologiesIn a decentralized system\nof autonomous, potentially self-interested agents, trust is the essential lubricant that enables col-\nlaboration and reduces uncertainty. To make informed decisions about whom to interact with and\ndelegate tasks to, agents need a mechanism to assess the reliability and competence of their peers.\n8.4 The Human-Agent Interface: Ensuring Goal Alignment and Control\nThis section focuses on the critical interface between human users and autonomous agents. The\ncentral challenge is ensuring that an agent’s actions faithfully reflect the user’s true, often nuanced\nand evolving, intent. This requires solving deep problems of goal ambiguity, preference discovery,\nand the design of effective oversight mechanisms to maintain human control.\nThe Ambiguity Problem: From User Intent to Actionable GoalsThe first step in any\nagentic workflow is understanding the user’s goal. However, human language is often imprecise, and\nuser requests can be complex, ambiguous, or underspecified. An agent must be able to disambiguate\nthis input and translate it into a concrete, actionable plan. This often involves a process of active\ndisambiguation, where the agent poses clarifying questions to maximize information gain and narrow\nthe space of possible interpretations (Jiang et al., 2024).\nEliciting Nuanced Preferences A significant challenge in achieving goal alignment is that users\nthemselves often do not have fully formed, stable preferences. A substantial body of psychology\nresearch has demonstrated that preferences are often constructed “on the fly” at the time of decision-\nmaking, influenced by the immediate context and the options presented (Lawless et al., 2024).\nAn agent, therefore, cannot simply ask a user for their complete utility function. Instead, it must"}

This requires the agent to move beyond a\npassive question-answer model to become an active participant in the user’s reasoning process. The\ncost and accuracy of a user’s responses to preference queries are highly dependent on context; users\nrespond more easily and accurately to queries about situations they are currently or have recently\nexperienced. This makes naturalistic, chat-based elicitation a promising approach.\nHuman-in-the-Loop(HITL):DesigningEffectiveOversightArchitectures Giventhecur-\nrent limitations in agent reliability and alignment, incorporating a “human in the loop” (HITL) is\na critical mechanism for ensuring safety, accountability, and control, especially for high-stakes or\nirreversible actions. HITL represents a collaborative paradigm where humans and AI work together\nto optimize processes.\n8.5 Systemic Risks: Ensuring Safety, Security, and Robustness\nAs agents become more autonomous and capable of taking real-world actions, the risks they pose\nescalate dramatically. This section addresses the critical challenges of ensuring that agentic systems\nare secure from attack, robust to failure, and safe to deploy in high-stakes environments such as\nfinance and critical infrastructure.\nSafety and Security Challenges We explore the safety and security challenges of the agentic\nweb, where autonomous agents operate across open, dynamic environments. It categorizes threats\nacross cognitive, communication, and economic layers and highlights cascading risks that amplify\nsystem vulnerabilities. To address these issues, both human-involved and automated red teaming are\ndiscussed, with LLM-driven approaches offering scalability but requiring robust oversight. Defense\nstrategies include advanced guardrails with reasoning and lifelong learning, such as AGrail (Luo\net al., 2025) and GuardAgent (Xiang et al., 2025). While benchmarks like SafeArena (Tur et al.,\n2025) and ST-WebAgentBench (Levy et al., 2024) have made progress in evaluation, significant\ngaps remain, particularly in multimodal and reasoning safety, calling for further research in scalable,\nadaptive safety solutions.\nLong-Horizon Planning and Error RecoveryReal-world tasks are rarely simple, single-step\noperations. They often involve long-horizon plans with numerous sequential and parallel actions. In\ncomplex and partially observable environments, failures are not a possibility but a certainty.\nThe dual challenges are (1) creating and maintaining a coherent plan over a long sequence of steps\nwithout the plan degrading or becoming irrelevant, and (2) building in robust mechanisms for\ndetecting, diagnosing, and recovering from the inevitable errors, exceptions, and action failures that\nwill occur. Simple, sequential agentic chains that work well in prototypes often break under the\nvariability and load of real-world use because they lack graceful failure modes and recovery paths. A\nkey to robustness is moving beyond open-loop “plan-and-execute” paradigms to closed-loop systems\nthat can self-correct based on feedback from their actions (Nayak et al., 2024).\nThe Challenge of Autonomous Payments: Security and RegulationEmpowering agents\nwith the ability to spend money is a critical enabler for a transactional Agentic Web, but it also\nrepresents one of the highest-risk applications, facing immense technical, regulatory, and social\nhurdles.\n8.6 Socio-Economic Implications\nThe successful deployment of the Agentic Web would not be a mere technological evolution but a\nprofound socio-economic transformation, reshaping business models, labor markets, and the very\nstructure of the digital economy. This section explores the challenges and open questions related to\nthe economic viability and societal impact of this new paradigm.\n56"}

The Agentic Web necessitates a shift towards new, more direct forms of value\nexchange.\nThe ad-supported model, which monetizes human attention, is breaking down as agents become the\nprimary interface for information retrieval, disintermediating and reducing traffic to content web-\nsites. The challenge is to develop and scale new business models that are native to an economy of\nautomated actions, not human eyeballs. This likely involves a move towards transactional, subscrip-\ntion, and value-based pricing models. Emerging models already position agents as first-class business\nentities that can be customized and deployed by organizations, enabling new revenue streams. These\ninclude: Intelligence-as-a-Service, where the outputs of AI-powered research are sold on demand;\nZero Marginal Cost Services, where the incremental cost of serving another customer is near zero;\nand Value-Based Pricing, where customers pay for outcomes rather than time invested.\nFurthermore, theintegrationofblockchaintechnologypresentspromisingopportunitiesfortheAgen-\ntic Web’s economic foundation.

This convergence could enable new forms of au-\ntonomous economic activity where agents can independently engage in value creation and exchange\nwithout traditional intermediaries.\nEconomic Disruption: Labor Markets, Productivity, and Inequality The widespread\nadoption of AI agents promises massive gains in productivity and economic growth but also portends\nsignificant disruption to the labor market and carries the risk of exacerbating economic inequality.\nResearch suggests that generative AI alone could add trillions of dollars annually to the global econ-\nomy, but it could also automate a significant fraction of current work activities, affecting hundreds\nof millions of jobs worldwide.\n9 Conclusion\nThe internet is undergoing a fundamental paradigm shift, evolving from a passive repository of\ninformation to a dynamic environment of action. This transition is powered by the emergence\nof the Agentic Web, a landscape populated by autonomous systems capable of perceiving their\nenvironment, reasoning through complex problems, and executing tasks to achieve specified goals.\nThis marks a significant leap from generative AI, which excels at responding to human prompts, to\nagentic AI, which is characterized by proactive, independent decision-making and execution.\nReferences\nDeepak Bhaskar Acharya, Karthigeyan Kuppan, and B.

Our findings highlight\nMagentic-UI’s potential to advance safe and efficient human-agent collaboration.1\n1 Introduction\nRecent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) have enabled\nthe development of capable AI agents that can autonomously complete complex, multi-step tasks by\ninteracting with their environment using external tools. For instance, browser-use and computer-use\nagents such as Operator and Claude Computer Use [103, 97, 87, 94] can control a live web browser\nor computer to complete tasks similar to how a human would. Coding agents such as OpenHands,\nGitHub Copilot, and Devin [89, 22, 13] can write and edit code to resolve issues in large codebases\nand even submit pull requests. DeepResearch [56] agents can browse hundreds of webpages and\nexecute code to produce reports for user queries. Completion of these tasks requires using diverse\ntools over a relatively long period, ranging from a few minutes to a few hours.\nWhile autonomous agents promise to increase user productivity by automating tedious work,\ncurrent agents still fall short of human-level performance in domains such as browser use [102, 15],\ncomputer use [98, 38], software development [103], general research [24] scientific research [77],\ncustomer support [31, 32], among other domains [100]. Moreover, as agents begin to interact more\ndirectly with the external world, they introduce new attack surfaces for adversarial manipulation\nthat can lead to harmful actions [40, 116, 114, 55, 17, 86]. Misalignment between agent behavior\nand human intentions [25, 72] or values [2, 12] can lead to similarly damaging outcomes, such as\ntaking irreversible actions, violating user preferences, or exposing private data. These shortcomings\nand vulnerabilities pose significant obstacles to the safe and reliable deployment of agent-based\nautomation.\nWe argue thata key solution to the shortcomings of today’s agents is to design them to interact\neffectively with humans-in-the-loop. By enabling humans and agents to collaborate, each contributing\ntheir strengths, we can extract productivity benefits from these imperfect systems while maintaining\noversight and control. Moreover, even as tomorrow’s agents become more capable and reliable,\nwe believe that human involvement will remain essential for preserving human agency, resolving\nunforeseen ambiguities, and guiding agents in adapting to an ever-changing world.\nRealizing the potential of AI agents in increasing productivity while maintaining human oversight\nand control requires developing effective interaction mechanisms that integrate humans into the\nloop with minimal human cost. Achieving this balance demands careful design and systematic\nexperimentation with human-agent interaction [7]. To this end, we introduceMagentic-UI2, an\nopen-source end-user-facing application for facilitating the development and study of human-in-the-\nloop agentic systems. Magentic-UI is powered by an extensible multi-agent system adapted from\nMagentic-One [21] that can browse and perform actions on the web, generate and execute code, and\ngenerate and analyze files. Its architecture consists of a lead Orchestrator agent that directs a set\nof agents to perform actions.

After they type their task in the interface, they engage inco-planning with Magentic-UI\nto use the correct booking link and clarify the pick-up spot using the plan editor component. Once\nMagentic-UI starts executing the task, the employee can intervene viaco-tasking to interrupt the\nagent and select a different shuttle seat by manipulating the agent’s browser (rightmost side of Figure\n2). Magentic-UI can call in the employee to enter their payment information and approve the booking\nvia action approvals.

Bringing the human back in the loop disrupts the idea of full automation\nand incurs extra cost. However, the hope is that the human solving tasks alongside the agent can\nachieve a sufficient level of task performance while being less costly than humans doing all the work\nby themselves. The literature on human-agent and human-AI interaction has both positive and\nnegative results in regard to the value of human-in-the-loop. For instance, GitHub Copilot has\nbeen shown to increase productivity in real world randomized control trials [63, 14]. On the other\nhand, there is a vast amount of negative results on human-AI collaboration showing that human-AI\nteams under-perform their individual parts due to overreliance or underreliance on AI [84, 8, 6, 52].\nHowever, interacting with agents is different than interacting with traditional AI models [7, 75].\nThere are two main distinguishing factors: 1)Long running and complex tasks:agents complete\nlong-running and complex tasks that may take hours to solve and 2)Actions can affect the real\nworld: agents can act on the environment and cause irreversible side-effects.\nLLM-Based Agents. Our work focuses on LLM-based agents which consist of iteratively calling\nLLMs equipped with tools in an agentic workflow [43, 96, 45, 11, 65, 66, 71, 47, 104, 113, 61, 29].\nThe agents rely on different prompting strategies such as CoT [92], ReACT [108] and few-shot\nprompting [115] as well as self-reflection and search mechanisms [95, 59, 62, 10, 107, 35, 79] and\n3"}

We adopt some of these design principles in designing our agents.\nWe use the multi-agent paradigm for the design of our agent system to allow for an easily extendable\nand modular system [80, 46, 26, 82, 70, 93, 81, 27, 43, 96, 45, 11, 90, 111, 67, 37, 39, 18, 5, 30]. The\nprogress in developing agentic systems has spurred many new benchmarks [48, 115, 98, 41, 109, 105,\n76, 16, 60, 36, 47], we selected a set of representative benchmarks that focus on interactions with\nlive websites to evaluate Magentic-UI.\nHuman-Agent Collaboration. Magentic-UI systematically explores and operationalizes the\ntaxonomy of open challenges in human-agent communication introduced in our prior work [7]. These\nchallenges encompass agent-to-user communication, user-to-agent communication, and cross-cutting\nissues aimed at improving grounding between people and agents. Magentic-UI offers a system for\ninvestigating these challenges in realistic computer-use settings. We revisit our progress on these\nchallenges via Magentic-UI in Section X.\nOur work also builds on an emerging literature exploring how humans and modern AI agents\ncan interact [20, 33, 58, 74, 7, 101, 19]. Cocoa [20] focuses on scientific research tasks and uses a\nsimilar co-planning interface as the one in Magentic-UI that allow for each step to be executed by\nthe human or the agent (co-execution). However, in contrast to Magentic-UI there is no dynamic\nhandoffs from the agent to the user and dynamic re-planning outside the co-planning phase and\nthe system consists of a single agent. CowPilot [33] introduces an interface for interacting with a\nweb agent through a browser extension in contrast to how Magentic-UI embeds the browser inside\nthe interface, the interaction in CowPilot is equivalent to directly interacting with the WebSurfer\nagent without the Orchestrator in Magentic-UI with pause/resume capabilities without co-planning,\nco-tasking and action approvals. The simulated user experiments in Magentic-UI are inspired by\nτ-bench [106] and Co-Gym [74] which simulate human interactions with agents.\n4"}

After the user specifies their task to the agent and\nbefore the agent performs any action, there is potential benefit in the human and agent collaborating\nto create a plan for the task. This is commonly referred to as co-planning and can take different\nforms, including directed clarifying questions, as seen in OpenAI’s DeepResearch [56], or directly\neditable plan components, such as those in GitHub Copilot Workspace [23] or Cocoa [20].\nPotential Benefits of Co-Planning. Co-planning front-loads the interaction cost with the user\nwith the goal of both reducing downstream interaction costs and improving the chance of success at\nthe task. We hypothesize the different ways co-planning can be useful:\n1. Resolving ambiguity:Co-planning can be helpful when users have ambiguous and under-\nspecified requests [72, 73, 1]). By surfacing the agent’s plan early in the interaction, this can\nhelp the user identify a lack of common ground between the agent and the user on the task.\nSince agent task execution can be time-consuming (ranging from a few minutes to several\nhours), resolving misalignment beforehand is significantly less costly than correcting it post\nhoc.\n2. Human priors: Co-planning enables the human to incorporate their prior expectations\nand prior knowledge of how the task should be performed. For example, if a user task is\n\"buy a charger for my Surface laptop,\" then a reasonable plan could be to \"find charger\non Amazon.com.\" However, if the user knows that the charger is only officially sold on\n\"microsoft.com,\" they can let the agent know to update their plan. In this instance, the task\nitself is not ambiguous, but the method of execution is.\n3. Human planning abilities:The user might have superior planning abilities compared to\nthe agent on certain domains, thus allowing for human-in-the-loop planning, which can be\nbeneficial [99, 85].\n4. Task Oversight:Finally, co-planning allows for transparency and oversight into the agent’s\nactions, allowing the human to monitor the agent’s activity less closely during task execution.\nImplementation in Magentic-UI. When users type in their task to Magentic-UI (they can\nalso upload arbitrary files), the Orchestrator agent firstreasons if the task is not clearand requires\nfurther clarifications from the user. If so, the Orchestrator responds with adirected questionto\nresolve this ambiguity. This is to gain the first benefit of co-planning outlined above. Now once the\ntask is well-specified from the perspective of the Orchestrator, Magentic-UI will generate a plan and\nexpose it to the user in the planning interface as shown in Figure 3.\nTo enable human input, the plan must be both easy to understand and edit. The user-facing plan\ndoes not match the agent’s internal representation, but any edits to the user-facing representation\nhave to be translatable to the agent’s plan. In Magentic-UI, aplan is a sequence of natural language\ninstructions, and the representation is shared between the user and the agent. A sequence of natural\nlanguage steps allows for ease of understanding, which comes at the cost of planning flexibility.\nAt the other extreme, if we allow the plan to be a Python program [88], we can have arbitrary\nflexibility, but it is harder for users to understand.\nThe plan is displayed in an interactive UI component that users can edit directly. Users can also\nsend text messages to edit the plan, giving them the choice to pick whatever method they find easiest\nto reduce the cost of co-planning. Exposing the plan as an editable component can allow us to gain\nbenefits (2) (human priors) and (3) (human intelligence) in co-planning. Finally, the plan structure\nin Magentic-UI also allows us to easily track task completion progress by counting how many steps\nof the plan have been completed to enable benefit (4) (task oversight) of co-planning: Magentic-UI\n5"}

To begin plan execution, the user\nmust explicitly press the \"Accept\" button or type \"accept\".\nIn the section that follows, we discuss how the user and Magentic-UI interact after the user\naccepts the plan.\n4 Collaborative Task Execution\nCollaborative Task Execution (Co-Tasking).Once agents start performing a task, they can\nencounter many obstacles that can hinder task completion. For instance, what if a product you\nasked the agent to purchase is no longer available? Or, what if the agent started deviating from the\nplan you both agreed to? To realize the benefits of humans-in-the-loop, we need to provide efficient\nmechanisms that enable the agent to query the human and allow the human to steer the agent’s\nbehavior at any moment, as well as verify its work. The human and agent collaborate to execute the\ntask, which we denote as co-tasking, also referred to as co-execution in the literature [20]. Co-tasking\ncan allow the human to intervene to complete steps the agent is unable to, e.g., CAPTCHA, allowing\nthe human-agent team to complement their individual strengths. Moreover, it allows the agent\nto ask clarifying questions when faced with unexpected ambiguity while completing the task. For\ninstance, if the agent is supposed to purchase a particular product but it is unavailable, it can ask\nthe user about potential substitutes. Finally, co-tasking can allow for interactive verification of\nagent actions during and after task execution is completed.\nFigure 4 shows the three ways in which co-tasking occurs in Magentic-UI: (a) the user interrupting\nthe agent to steer its behavior, (b) the agent interrupting the user to ask for help or clarifications,\nand (c) the user verifying the agent’s work and asking for follow-ups. All of these interactions occur\nwhen the user wants to solve a single task or is multitasking.\n6"}

Once the user accepts Magentic-UI’s plan, execution of the\ntask starts. The interface provides real-time updates on intermediate agent actions, allowing the\nuser to maintain continuous oversight. Each plan step appears as a collapsible banner in the task\nexecution view, containing all related agent actions. Once a plan step is completed, we collapse all\nagent actions for that step to not overwhelm the UI. Agent interactions with the web browser are\nanimated, giving users a live preview of upcoming actions. Users may pause the task execution at\nany point, providing clarifications, making adjustments to upcoming steps, or intervening directly\nwithin the embedded browser. As previously mentioned, Magentic-UI exposes the browser to the\nuser and hands off control immediately upon user intervention. Figure 4(a) shows what happens\nwhen a user interrupts Magentic-UI mid task-execution. After making adjustments, users can\nseamlessly resume automated execution, maintaining fluid collaboration between the human and\nagent. UX considerations here prioritize immediate actionability and clarity, reducing the cognitive\nload required for real-time monitoring.\nAgent Interrupting the User. The user is part of the underlying multi-agent team in Magentic-\nUI, this means that the Orchestrator can delegate steps of the plan to the user. Figure 4(b) shows\nthe agent asking the user a clarifying question in the middle of task execution. Each agent in the\nmulti-agent team has a natural language description field that helps the Orchestrator know which\nsteps of the plan it should delegate to that agent. That description field determines when the\nOrchestrator can delegate actions to the user. The guiding principle we followed is to interrupt\nthe user as little as possible and only when necessary. Therefore, we specified that we would only\ninterrupt the user for clarifying questions or help, but only after failures in completing the task from\nother agents. Here is the raw description field we used:\nThe description field is essentially a parameter that we can modify to control the user deferral\nbehavior. The main issue with optimizing this parameter is the lack of ground truth signals for\nwhen is the right time to interrupt the user. For the development of Magentic-UI, we arrived at\nthis description through unstructured interaction with the system. This is in contrast to work\non learning to defer in classification [44, 53] where there is a clear signal to identify when it is a\ngood time to defer to the user. Our simulated user experiments in Section 7.3 provide a possible\nenvironment for quantitatively choosing such parameters.\nFinal Answer Verification. Once the task is completed, Magentic-UI displays a final answer to\nthe user as shown in Figure 4(c). The final answer will consist of a text response, in addition to any\n7"}

The user can verify the answer by either going through\nthe agent actions for each step or by asking the agent follow-up questions in the UI. Follow-up\nquestions that can be answered without any agent actions are immediately returned to the user. If\nany follow-up query requires agent action, it essentially triggers a new planning phase that takes\ninto account the previous task.\nMultitasking. Magentic-UI allows the user to run multiple tasks at the same time. The user can\ninteract with each task session by switching between them, as shown in the left-hand side panel of\nthe interface in Figure 2. Each session has a session status indicator that displays whether user\ninput is required. We believe that multitasking is one of the keys to realizing the benefits of agents,\neven if agents are below human-level performance. This is because it is trivial to spin up a large\nnumber of agents that can make partial progress towards each task, which allows the human to\ncomplete it more easily. The main limiting factor here is humans’ ability to oversee and manage all\nthese agents.\nIn the next section, we discuss how Magentic-UI accommodates long-term user interactions by\nsaving and reusing existing plans.\n5 Agent Memory\nFigure 5: The saved plans view in Magentic-UI showing the users’ plans that they learned, created,\nor imported. Users can edit each plan entry or rerun the task.\nMemory Representation. Users expect their agent to learn and adapt from past experiences. If\nthe agent was able to solve a task once, the user expects the agent to be able to repeat this in the\nfuture for similar tasks. This becomes more critical if the user invested energy in co-tasking with\nthe agent to solve a given task. We represent memory in Magentic-UI as a set of plans in the format\nof plan steps(1), indexed by the task description. Memory is a set of saved plans(task, plan).\nThis representation is convenient as it provides a mechanism to easily re-execute existing plans\nby starting the Orchestrator with the chosen plan. Essentially, each memory entry (a plan) is a\nguide to solving a task, similar to work on agent workflows [91]. The primary use case of this form\nof memory is for repetitive tasks that a user might want to perform, such as \"create a structured\nreport based on the latest arxiv papers on agents\" or \"book my shuttle to work for tomorrow.\" Note\n8"}

While we don’t focus on such aspects of\nmemory, we imagine they can also be integrated into Magentic-UI. We now discuss how users can\npopulate the memory by interacting with Magentic-UI and how memory entries are retrieved in\nfuture tasks.\nLearning Plans From Task Execution.Once Magentic-UI completes a task, users have the\noption for Magentic-UI to learn a plan based on the execution of the task. Essentially, the entire\ntask execution trace, including any user messages, is fed into an LLM that is prompted to synthesize\nan Orchestrator plan; see Appendix C.1 for the exact prompt. This approach is similar to prior\nwork [91, 69, 68]. Learned plans are saved in a \"Saved Plans\" gallery shown in Figure 5 where users\ncan inspect, edit, download, upload, and create new plans from scratch.\nPlan Retrieval. Once a plan is saved in the plans gallery, the user has multiple paths to re-using\nit. To rerun the same plan on the original task, they can navigate to the gallery and click ’Run plan’\n(see Figure 5). To use a saved plan as guidance for a new task, users have two options: (1) relevant\nplans are suggested via an autocomplete-style interface, allowing users to attach one directly to\ntheir query, or (2) users can manually attach a plan using the ’Attach plan’ option under the input\nbox. Re-using a plan as a guide for a new task is useful when users want to change task parameters:\nfor instance if we saved a plan for the task \"create a structured report based on latest arxiv papers\non agents\", we can attach this plan with the query \"for new transformer architectures\" to get the\nreport on our new topic.\nFinally, we also allow for automatic plan retrieval by the Orchestrator using AutoGen’s Task\nCentric Memory3, a configuration users have to enable. Each saved Orchestrator plan is treated\nas a Memo by the TaskCentricMemoryController; when Magentic-UI receives a new task, it first\ngeneralizes the task, generates and embeds multi-word topic vectors with an LLM, then queries the\nvector-DB (ChromaDB) MemoryBank for the nearest matching topics to surface the most similar\nstored plans. The candidate plans are subsequently passed through an LLM relevance filter, trimmed\nto the single most relevant plan if any, and returned to the Orchestrator, where they are used as a\nhint to generate a plan given the user’s task.\nIn the next section, we discuss the implementation details of Magentic-UI.\n6 System Implementation\n6.1 Overall Design\nThe implementation of Magentic-UI consists of three main components: (A) the underlying\nmulti-agent team, (B) the user interface, and (C) the backend for managing different teams across\nsessions and users. This is illustrated in Figure 6, further detailed below:\nAgent Team (A). The multi-agent team powering Magentic-UI is an adaptation of the Magentic-\nOne architecture [21]. Specifically, Magentic-UI is adapted to be more interactive and to better\nenable human-agent communication, rather than being fully autonomous. Like Magentic-One,\nMagentic-UI is implemented using AutoGen [93], and relies on a lead Orchestrator agent to direct a\nset of agents to perform steps in furtherance of a shared goal. In Magentic-UI, the user interacting\nwith Magentic-UI is treated as an extra agent in the team (referred to as UserProxy). The agents\nhave access to a shared workspace on the user’s machine, Docker containers for code execution,\nand a web browser (also launched from Docker). In both cases, Docker sandboxing is crucial for\nisolating agent activity and mitigating numerous security risks. We expand on the description of\nthe agent team (A) in subsections 6.2 (Orchestrator) and 6.3 (agents).\n3https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/python/packages/autogen-ext/src/autogen_ext/\nexperimental/task_centric_memory\n9"}

Finally,\nthe UI allows users to modify the configuration of Magentic-UI, most importantly to change the\nunderlying LLM powering the agents. In the following subsection, we discuss the orchestration\nbetween the agents and the user in Magentic-UI.\n6.2 Multi-Agent Architecture and Orchestration\nThe underlying architecture of the Magentic-UI agent team consists of a lead Orchestrator\nagent and sub-agents who perform actions on the request of the Orchestrator. The orchestrator is\nresponsible for interacting with the user to understand the task, create a plan, assign steps of the\nplan to an adequate agent, track progress of task execution, and generate a final response back to\nthe user. Essentially, the Orchestrator agent dictates the flow of interaction between the user and\nMagentic-UI. The Orchestrator has two operating modes: planning mode, when the user and the\nsystem interact to decide on a plan, and execution mode, when the plan is executed to complete the\ntask. We now describe the operation of the Orchestrator in each of these two modes and provide\nmore details on plan creation and plan execution. An overview of the Orchestrator is shown in\nFigure 7.\nPlanning Mode. When the user types in their query to Magentic-UI, the Orchestrator generates\na plan in response. When generating the plan, the Orchestrator can use web search and can retrieve\nrelevant plans from memory (discussed in Section 5). A plan is a list of an arbitrary number of\nsteps, where each step consists of a title, a details field, and the name of the agent assigned to\ncomplete the step. The plan structure can be considered a sequential domain-specific language\n10"}

Out\nof the box, Magentic-UI is configured with the following agents: WebSurfer, Coder, FileSurfer,\nUserProxy, and optionally a variable number of MCP agents configured with external tools. These\nagents interact with the outside world and can pose safety and security risks [86]. This can occur as\nagents that interact with the web become targets of adversarial attacks such as prompt injections\nfrom nefarious actors [40]. Even in the absence of adversarial actors, agents may not be perfectly\naligned with human preferences and intents, for instance, they may reach out to governmental\nagencies for freedom of information requests [21] or decide to purchase products without approval.\nWe implement two levels of safeguards for agent actions in Magentic-UI:internal agent safeguards\nthrough agent implementation decisions detailed below andexternal agent safeguardsover the\nagent’s actions detailed in the following subsection 6.4.\nWe now discuss the implementation of the Magentic-UI agents.\nWebSurfer. The WebSurfer is an agent that, given a multimodal input query, manipulates a web\nbrowser based on the query. It then returns a multimodal message listing the actions it performed,\nand the final state of the browser page (including a screenshot). The WebSurfer is implemented as\nan LLM loop, augmented with tools, where each tool represents a specific action on the browser (e.g.,\nclicking a button, scrolling the page) [51]. It is adapted from Magentic-One’s MultiModalWebSurfer\n[21], but includes a larger action space, and has the ability to perform multiple steps per request.\nAs noted earlier, WebSurfer’s browser is launched inside a Docker container, limiting the agent’s\naccess to the user’s file system, resources, or native browser state (e.g., sessions, history, etc). The\nWebSurfer also implements an allow-list configuration where users can set a list of websites that the\nagent is allowed to access. If the WebSurfer needs to access a website outside of the allow-list, users\nmust explicitly approve it through the interface.\nCoder Agent. The coder agent is an LLM specialized through its system prompt to generate\nself-contained Python or Bash code to solve a broad range of problems. If the LLM response contains\ncode, it is automatically executed in an isolated Docker container, and the output of the execution\nis fed back as context to the model. If the code execution results in an error (an explicit error code),\nthe agent can regenerate the code to correct the issue up to three times, or until the errors are\nresolved.\nFileSurfer Agent. Implemented as a single LLM call with tools, FileSurfer handles local file\noperations and conversions. Running in a Docker container equipped with MarkItDown tools [50],\nFileSurfer locates files, converts document formats (e.g., PDF to Markdown), and performs structured\nqueries on file content. This capability is essential for tasks involving document summarization and\nstructured data extraction.\nMCP Agent(s) (Optional). The MCP agent enables wrapping one or more remote MCP (Model\nContext Protocol) servers into a custom agent that can participate in the team. Each server’s tools\nare unified into a unified set, abstracting server boundaries and avoiding naming conflicts. The user\ninterface allows users to add one or many MCP servers into one or many agents that they can define.\nUserProxy Agent. Finally, the UserProxy agent is a representation of the user interacting with\nMagentic-UI. The Orchestrator can delegate steps to the user, and any response submitted through\nthe interface is routed as if it came from the UserProxy agent. The description field we used for the\nUserProxy is the following:\nUserProxy Description: The human user who gave the original task. The human user"}

Our ActionGuard system is implemented\nthrough a two-stage process, combining action type heuristics and an ActionGuard LLM-based\njudge, as illustrated in Figure 8. Any agent action in Magentic-UI carries with it a pre-defined\nirreversibility heuristic set by the developer with three possible values:always irreversible (e.g.,\nuploading a file),maybe irreversible (e.g., clicking a button), andnever irreversible (e.g., scrolling a\npage). If the heuristic is always irreversible, the human user is prompted to approve or disapprove a\nbinary action decision. If the heuristic is never irreversible, the action is automatically executed. If\nthe heuristic is maybe irreversible, we pass the action proposal to the ActionGuard judge, which\nis implemented as an LLM with a custom system prompt inspired by prior work [112] shown in\nAppendix B. The ActionGuard judge determines whether the action requires human approval before\nit is executed.\nIn the next section, we outline our evaluation protocol and present the results.\n7 Evaluation\n7.1 Setup\nWe perform different types of evaluations to understand Magentic-UI’s task-solving performance\n(subsection 7.2), user-interaction quality (subsection 7.3 and subsection 7.4), interface usability\n(subsection 7.4) and resilience to safety and security attacks (subsection 7.5). To perform automated\nevaluations of Magentic-UI, we remove the UserProxy agent from the multi-agent team and we change\nthe following configurations of Magentic-UI allowing it to act autonomously: we can selectively turn\non/off co-planning (not require user approval to select the plan), turn on/off co-tasking (user is\nremoved from the agent team) and turn on/off action guards (all actions are auto-approved). This\nallows us to compare Magentic-UI to autonomous agent systems. All evaluations and benchmarks\nare implemented in a framework we built for agentic evaluation in the Magentic-UI repository found\n14"}

We select a set of representative benchmarks that test for general AI agent abilities,\nand especially for web browsing capabilities. The first benchmark we consider isGAIA [47], which\nconsists of 465 question–answer pairs. Importantly, in GAIA each question can have additional\nattachments in the form of files and images, and may require code execution, file understanding, and\nweb browsing. In each case, answer evaluation is done by matching candidate answers to ground\ntruth strings in a deterministic manner (i.e., string matches, but allowing for some modest variation).\nGAIA is split into an open validation set with 165 question-answer pairs and a test set with 300\nquestions (answers hidden).5 An example of a GAIA task is:\nExample GAIA task:Compute the check digit the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales\nwould have if it were an ISBN-10 number.\nThe second benchmark we evaluate on isAssistantBench [109], which consists of 214 question–\nanswer pairs. To answer these questions, a system requires the ability to conduct deep web searches,\nand be able to interact with online web pages. Answer evaluation is performed using two metrics:\none is an exact match, and the second is an F1 score comparison between a candidate string\nanswer and the ground truth string answer. AssistantBench is split into an open validation set with\n33 question-answer pairs and a test set with 181 questions (answers hidden). An example of an\nAssistantBench task is:\nExample AssistantBench task: What Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150\nminutes and available on Netflix US has the highest IMDB rating?\nThe third benchmark we evaluate on isWebVoyager [28], which consists of 643 natural language\ninstructions representing tasks that require interacting with one of 15 live websites such as Book-\ning.com, Google Maps, and others. The agent must provide a candidate string answer, alongside\nscreenshots of the web pages it traversed to complete the task. For answer evaluation,WebVoyager\nuses a GPT-4 based evaluator as a judge. It takes the task, the agent’s answer, and the list of\nscreenshots produced by the agent, then returns a binary indicator of task success. The judge\nevaluation prompt focuses more on the screenshots than on the textual output of the agent to\nevaluate correctness. Several WebVoyager tasks are anchored to the year2024. We modify the\ninstructions to point to2025 so that they are solvable. An example WebVoyager task is:\nExample WebVoyager Task:[Booking.com] Search for hotels in Rio de Janeiro from\nMarch 1-7, 2024 June 1-5, 2025, check the Brands filter to see which brand has the most\nhotels and which brand has the fewest.\nWe note that evaluation practices forWebVoyager vary across prior work, with differences in the\nuse of human evaluators, LLM judges, task filtering, and dataset modification.\nThe final benchmark we evaluate on isConvergence WebGames[83] 6, which consists of 53\ninteractive tasks on a specially hosted site. Each task consists of a webpage with the instructions\nwritten at the top of the page. The agent must complete the task until the webpage displays a\n\"password,\" which indicates task success.WebGames tests for more low-level agent web browsing\ncapabilities in very challenging scenarios. An example task is:\nExample WebGames Task:[Menu Navigator] Navigate through the menu bar below\nto find the secret option. Click it to reveal the password!\nSystem Details. All evaluations were performed in April and May of 2025. We use two different\nLLMs to power Magentic-UI: o4-mini (2025-04-16) and GPT-4o (2024-08-06).

In Table 1, we show the performance of Magentic-UI compared to the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) on the individual benchmarks as well as relevant baselines. We first find that Magentic-UI\nmatches the performance of our previous autonomous multi-agent team, Magentic-One [21], on\nGAIA and AssistantBench, despite the modifications we made in Magentic-UI for improved user\ninteractivity. However, the performance of Magentic-UI falls short of the current SOTA on GAIA.\nThe second observation is that Magentic-UI, with o4-mini, achieves performance comparable to that\nof SOTA on WebVoyager and WebGames. This indicates that the WebSurfer agent in Magentic-UI\nis indeed a capable web agent. When using GPT-4o, Magentic-UI achieves a performance of 72.2%\non WebVoyager, which is comparable to the performance reported for GPT-4o in WebVoyager [28].\nHowever, it falls short of Browser Use, which uses GPT-4o.\nTable 1: Performance of Magentic-UI compared to a selection of baselines on the test sets of\nGAIA and AssistantBench and on WebVoyager and WebGames.

This indicates that the agent runtime is correlated with the likelihood of it getting\nthe task correct. Magentic-UI spends more time on tasks that it ends up getting incorrectly, likely\nbecause it is trying multiple approaches.\nAdditional Analysis on Planning. In Figure 10, we show the likelihood of Magentic-UI re-\nplanning in any given task and summary statistics about Magentic-UI plan length across all four\nbenchmarks evaluated. We first notice that median plan length is two steps across all of WebVoyager,\nGAIA, and AssistantBench. However, we find that GAIA and AssistantBench may trigger longer\nplans of up to 9 steps compared to only 5 steps for WebVoyager. We notice that for WebGames the\nchance of replanning is 52.9%, which is roughly equal to Magentic-UI failure rate. This is because\nWebGames has a verifiable signal of success; the agent will not stop until it can unlock the password,\nwhereas other benchmarks, like GAIA, do not have any inherent signal of success, so the agent\nneeds to figure out when to stop on its own.\n7.3 Simulated User Evaluation\nTo evaluate the human-in-the-loop capabilities of Magentic-UI, we transform the GAIA bench-\nmark into aninteractive benchmarkby introducing a simulated user akin to simulated benchmarks\nsuch asτ-bench [106]. Simulated users in our setting provide value in two ways: by having specific\nexpertise that the agent may not possess, and by providing guidance on how the task should be\nperformed.\n17"}

We show\nthe chance of Magentic-UI re-planning in a task, the maximum length of a plan, and the median\nand average plan length.\nSetup. We experiment with two types of simulated users to show the value of human-in-the-loop:\n(1) a simulated user that is more intelligent than the Magentic-UI agents and (2) a simulated\nuser with the same intelligence as Magentic-UI agents but with additional information about the\ntask. During co-planning, Magentic-UI takes feedback from this simulated user to improve its plan.\nDuring co-tasking, Magentic-UI can ask the (simulated) user for help when it gets stuck. Finally, if\nMagentic-UI does not provide a final answer, then the simulated user provides an answer instead.\nThese experiments reflect a lower bound on the value of human feedback, since real users can step\nin at any time and offer any kind of input-not just when the system explicitly asks for help.\nSimulated User. The simulated user is an LLM without any tools, instructed to interact with\nMagentic-UI the way we expect a human would act. The first type of simulated user relies on\nOpenAI’s o4-mini, which outperforms the LLM powering the Magentic-UI agents (GPT-4o) on\nmany tasks. For the second type of simulated user, we use GPT-4o for both the simulated user and\nthe rest of the agents, but the user has access to side information about each task. Each task in\nGAIA has side information, which includes a human-written plan to solve the task. While this plan\nis not used in the standard benchmark setting, we provide it to the second simulated user to mimic\na knowledgeable human. To avoid leaking the ground-truth answer - often embedded in the plan -\nwe carefully tuned the simulated user’s prompt to guide Magentic-UI indirectly. We found that this\ntuning prevented the simulated user from inadvertently revealing the answer in all but 6% of tasks\nwhen Magentic-UI provides a final answer.\nResults. On the validation subset of GAIA (162 tasks), we show in Figure 11 the results of\nMagentic-One operating in autonomous mode, Magentic-UI operating in autonomous mode (without\nthe simulated user), Magentic-UI with simulated user (1) (smarter model), Magentic-UI with\nsimulated user (2) (side-information), and human performance. We first note that Magentic-UI in\nautonomous mode is within a margin of error of the performance of Magentic-One. Note that the\n18"}

This demonstrates the potential of even lightweight\nhuman feedback for improving performance (e.g., task completion) over autonomous agents working\nalone, especially at a fraction of the cost compared to people completing tasks entirely manually.\n7.4 Qualitative User Study\nWe conducted a qualitative user study in order to understand the role of Magentic-UI’s human-in-\nthe-loop features supporting output quality with low costs to the users. As this was not a long-term\nstudy, we did not investigate the role of memory in the Magentic-UI system, instead focusing on\nco-planning, co-tasking, action guards, multitasking, and verification.\nProcedure. We recruited 12 users to participate in an hour-long study. All participants had some\nfamiliarity with agentic systems: in the past 30 days 83% had recently used a research agent, and\n50% had used a computer-use agent. All participants had not previously used Magentic-UI. Each\nparticipant was provided with a machine pre-installed with Magentic-UI.

P3 expressed\ninterest in the long-form task of tracking flight prices over time before purchasing.\nLatency, model errors, and verbosity remain as pain points.Latency, stemming from both\nthe model and the application, was the main pain point for our participants [P2, P4, P5, P6, P9,\nP10, P11, P12]. Regarding latency when switching between tasks in the multitasking scenario, P9\nnoted that \"there’s some instances where like, I can’t switch immediately. That impacts the user\nexperience for sure.\" Participants noted that multitasking with the security of action guards would\nmitigate latency concerns [P4, P7, P9, P11]. Additionally, P11 appreciated the visual component\nof Magentic-UI, noting that for text-only agents \"you wouldn’t necessarily know why it’s taking\nso long, but for this ... the processes [are] like shown to you and ... it’s easier for the user to like\nidentify where it’s going to like repetitive.\"\nParticipants were understanding of technical errors such as not processing a website’s fonts [P10],\nrepeatedly scrolling left when that affordance was not possible [P2], and difficulty interacting with\nmaps [P8]. However, participants at times expressed disappointment when Magentic-UI did not\nscroll to collect requested options beyond the first set that became visible [P1, P7, P8, P12], did not\nintegrate their changes to the plan [P3, P5, P6], or ran into CAPTCHAs that would not approve,\neven with co-tasking [P3, P5].\nAdditionally, some participants found the reasoning text to be too verbose [P2, P6, P11] and\nthe plans to be wordy and incorporate multiple concepts into one step [P3, P6, P7, P11, P12],\nalthough summaries were appreciated [P2, P7]. P1 and P11 also noted that the screenshots could\nbe repetitive and not tied to semantic meaning.\nParticipants value co-planning because plans can be subjective and difficult to predict.\nParticipants often edited the plan before execution, usually to incorporate subjective preferences\n[P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P11]. They found articulating plans to be easy [P5, P7, P9, P10], even\neasier than creating the plan themselves [P6]. Many participants found that Magentic-UI followed\nplans faithfully [P7, P9, P10, P11]. P6 shared that \"I think from a ... safety perspective with quotes\n... [co-planning is] my favorite part of the UI.\"\nParticipants also raised the importance of co-planning throughout the task execution process,\nas people and AI are unlikely to anticipate all possible decision criteria. They noted appreciation\nwhen Magentic-UI adapted the plan when running into errors [P5, P6]. While Magentic-UI ran,\nparticipants changed aspects of the plan, with varying degrees of success [P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7,\nP8, P10, P11, P12]. When Magentic-UI did not successfully adapt to a change in plan, P5 expressed\nfrustration that \"it seemed like it had a set idea of what it wanted to do and it wasn’t ... flexible to\nwhen I like added a certain option.\" To support this valued process of changing plans dynamically,\nparticipants requested the ability to give a third option when action guards appeared [P5, P7, P11,\nP12] and increased visibility of changes to the plan [P8, P10, P11].\nCo-tasking helps adapt to errors and retain user control when desired.Participants\nused co-tasking to adapt to frustrating or incorrect model behavior, such as latency [P2, P4, P5, P6,\nP8, P9, P10, P11] or perceived errors [P1, P2, P6, P7, P8, P9, P11].

Participants desired\nvarying degrees of control over this sensitive data, from wanting the convenience of the system\nknowing passwords [P4, P9], to wanting full control [P6, P10], to being unsure and wanting a mix\n[P2]. P2 shared that \"giving my zip code to the agent, [I’m] not sure how comfortable I’d be with\nthat,\" while acknowledging that people have different needs and preferences as \"my family are not\nreally great with computers and they forget their password all the time. So I would assume an\naverage person would want [password autofill] to be a thing.\"\nAction approvals and interruptions are desired for critical decisions and clarification.\nSome participants thought that there was the right amount of action approvals [P7, P11] or expressed\na preference for having more action guards than critically necessary to ensure no necessary decisions\nhappen without approval [P2, P6]. Others thought that the action approval to add items to cart\nwas not needed, as this action was perceived as low risk [P1, P3, P5, P8, P9, P12]. Participants\nendorsed action guards for actions perceived as high risk such as payment [P1, P2, P6, P7], sending\nemails [P1], or subscribing [P7].\nMultiple participants noted that, in particular, making a request to change the plan, then\nhaving an action approval appear to agree to the new plan felt excessive [P3, P8, P9]. However,\nparticipants appreciated interruptions for clarifying questions [P2, P12] and expressed a desire for\nmore clarification interruptions when tasks are underspecified [P2, P3, P6, P7, P11].

Although P12 felt uncomfortable having a non-deterministic process operating on\ntheir behalf, they expressed that \"watching what it’s doing the whole time .. defeats the whole\npurpose.\" Others felt more comfortable having agents operating in the background because of\nMagentic-UI’s human-in-the-loop features [P4, P7, P9].

As noted throughout the paper, a variety of\ndesign choices were made to decrease risk. These include: action guard, running various agents in\nsandboxed containers, and ensuring that Magentic-UI has its own browser distinct from the user’s\n(so that credentials and session cookies are not shared).\nTo verify the necessity and effectiveness of these mitigations, we evaluated Magentic-UI on an\ninternal set of 24 adversarial scenarios outlined in Appendix D with the full results. The scenarios\nincluded situations where Magentic-UI was subjected to:\n• Direct requests to take risky actions, such as reading private SSH keys from disk\n• Social engineering attacks such as egregious requests for OAuth permissions (Figure 14), and\nmalicious browser update popups (Appendix D, figure 13)\n• Targeted cross-site prompt injection attacks, designed to confuse LLM-based agents.

A key challenge in human-agent collaboration is effectively communicating\nuser goals and intentions to an agent. This can stem from various factors including vague or\nunderspecified user goals, ambiguity in natural language, and a lack of shared context.\nMagentic-UI aims to address this challenge via co-planning, an interaction mechanism designed\nto efficiently align the agent’s plan of action with the user’s intended goal through ashared plan\nrepresentation. While our evaluation results showed that co-planning enabled efficient up-front plan\nverification and editing, we also found several opportunities for improvement:\n• An agent’s actions might deviate from a plan due to misalignment in plan representation.\nEach agent in Magentic-UI can perform multiple actions in a single plan step allowing it to\ninternally replan in case of errors without going back to the orchestrator. We also often find\nthat the agent might perform more actions in a step than what the step description entailed.\n• Magentic-UI’s approach uses a limited DSL consisting of natural language steps, which enables\neasy user verification but may limit the agent’s capabilities. Magentic-UI’s current planning\nstructure, for instance, does not accommodate branching or parallel steps; however, this can\nbe potentially accommodated by enriching the plan DSL.\n• Plan editing may become too cost-prohibitive as the number of steps to review increases.\nFuture opportunities may include hierarchical plan representations or differentiating between\nsteps that the agent needs feedback on and other steps that can be safely ignored.\nAction histories, progress bars, and notifications to convey what the agent is doing\n(Challenge A3) or is about to do (Challenge A2).Given that agents can take (sometimes\nirreversible) actions in the real world, it is critical to maintain an appropriate level of human\noversight. However, efficiently conveying what agents are doing or about to do remains challenging.\nMagentic-UI provides multiple levels of support to help people monitor its progress so they\ncan intervene when necessary, including action-observation histories, task level progress and status\nindicators, and action guards to pull in users when it runs into difficulties or is uncertain. Yet, our\nevaluations revealed several open problems with these mechanisms:\n• Despite using a progressive disclosure approach to show Magentic-UI’s work, providing\ninformation hierarchically via collapsible panels at the task, step, and action levels, many\nqualitative study participants found it overwhelming to monitor or review long task histories\nto understand what happened or troubleshoot. Instead, participants requested more visual\naids (e.g., video summaries) to help the quickly assess the agent’s work.\n• While Magentic-UI provides action guards, designed to notify people when it gets stuck or\nneeds help, several participants found the number of requests for feedback excessive. Prior\nwork has shown that people’s sensitivity to interruptions depends on several factors including\nthe task at hand and their risk tolerance. An open problem then is in how to tune agents to\ninterrupt in a way that is compatible with user preferences without sacrificing task completion\nrates. This problem could also be approached as a learning problem where, as users develop\ntrust with an agent, they may prefer fewer action approval decisions.\nStatus indicators, background tasks, and answer verification mechanisms to help people\nassess whether the agent’s goal was achieved (Challenge A5).We don’t always expect\nusers to sit and watch agents do work, sometimes it’s best to run them in the background and check\nin when needed. Verifying agent behavior (Challenge X1) and, in particular, assessing whether an\nagent’s goal was indeed achieved (Challenge A5) becomes extra challenging when assuming people"}

This suggests that further research is needed to efficiently\nsummarize what the agent did, particularly in the case where people are not expected to be closely\nmonitoring the task at hand.\n8.2 Limitations\nMagentic-UI task completion capabilities shares similar limitations to Magentic-One [21] and\nother agentic systems. Performance of Magentic-UI on general AI assistant benchmarks is still\nbehind human-level performance. Magentic-UI particularly struggles at tasks that require advanced\ncoding abilities, such as SWE-Bench [34], tasks that require multimodal understanding, such as\nvideo data, tasks that require very long sequences of web actions, or tasks that require general\ncomputer use.\nMagentic-UI was designed and tested using the English language. Performance in other languages\nmay vary and should be assessed by someone who is both an expert in the expected outputs and a\nnative speaker of that language. Outputs generated by AI may include factual errors, fabrication,\nor speculation. Users are responsible for assessing the accuracy of generated content. All decisions\nleveraging outputs of the system should be made with human oversight and not be based solely on\nsystem outputs. Magentic-UI inherits any biases, errors, or omissions produced by the model used.\nDevelopers are advised to choose an appropriate LLM carefully, depending on the intended use case.\nOur evaluation of Magentic-UI did not measure downstream productivity benefits of using\nthe system and was restricted to simulated evaluations and qualitative insights. To measure the\nproductivity benefits of Magentic-UI requires long-term controlled trials of people completing tasks\nwith and without the system. We hope that in future work we can obtain better signals of any\nproductivity benefits.\n8.3 Risks and Mitigations\nHuman agency and oversight are foundational to Magentic-UI’s design. From the ground up,\nMagentic-UI was created with a human-in-the-loop (HIL) philosophy that places the user in control\nof agent behavior. Every action Magentic-UI takes – whether navigating the web, manipulating\ndata, or executing code – is preceded by a transparent planning phase where the proposed steps are\nsurfaced for review. Plans are only executed with explicit user approval, and users retain the ability\nto pause, modify, or interrupt the agent at any time. When Magentic-UI encounters a scenario it\ndeems high-impact or non-reversible, such as navigating to a new domain or initiating a potentially\nrisky action, it proactively requests confirmation before proceeding. The user can also configure\nMagentic-UI to always ask for permission before performing any action. This approach reinforces\nuser autonomy while minimizing unintended or unsafe behavior.\nOne of the key safety features in Magentic-UI is the ability to set a set of allowed websites.\nThe allowed websites represent the set of websites that Magentic-UI can visit without explicit user\napproval. If Magentic-UI needs to visit a website outside the allowed list, it will ask the user for\nexplicit approval by mentioning the exact URL, the page title, and the reason for visiting the\nwebsite.\nTo address safety and security concerns, Magentic-UI underwent targeted red-teaming to assess\nits behavior under adversarial and failure scenarios. Such scenarios include cross-site prompt\ninjection attacks where web pages contain malicious instructions distinct from the user’s original\nintents (e.g., to execute risky code, access sensitive files, or perform actions on other websites).\nIt also contains scenarios comparable to phishing, which try to trick Magentic-UI into entering\nsensitive information, or granting permissions on impostor sites (e.g., a synthetic website that\nasks Magentic-UI to log in and enter Google credentials to read an article). In our preliminary\nevaluations, we found that Magentic-UI either refuses to complete the requests, stops to ask the user,"}

This\neffectively shields the host environment from agent activities. Sensitive data such as chat history,\nuser settings, and execution logs is stored locally to preserve user privacy and minimize exposure.\nTo safely operate Magentic-UI, always run it within the provided Docker containers, and strictly\nlimit its access to only essential resources, avoiding sharing unnecessary files, folders, or logging into\nwebsites through the agent. Never share sensitive data you wouldn’t confidently send to external\nproviders like Azure or OpenAI. Magentic-UI shares browser screenshots with model providers\nincluding all data users choose to enter on websites in Magentic-UI s browser. Ensure careful human\noversight by meticulously reviewing proposed actions and monitoring progress before approving.\nFinally, approach its output with appropriate skepticism; Magentic-UI can hallucinate, misattribute\nsources, or be misled by deceptive or low-quality online content.\nWe strongly encourage users to use LLMs/MLLMs that support robust Responsible AI mitiga-\ntions, such as Azure Open AI (AOAI) services. Such services continually update their safety and\nRAI mitigations with the latest industry standards for responsible use.\n8.4 Conclusion\nAutonomous agents promise productivity gains, but fall short in complex, real-world tasks due to\nambiguity, misalignment, and safety risks. We argued that human-in-the-loop interaction is essential–\nnot as a fallback, but as a core design principle. Magentic-UI embodies this principle. Its architecture\nsupports co-planning, co-tasking, and verification, enabling users to guide agent behavior, intervene\nwhen needed, and validate outcomes. Our experiments show that these mechanisms have the\npotential to improve task success and reduce oversight burden. By releasing Magentic-UI as an open-\nsource platform, we invite researchers to test similar hypotheses, extend interaction mechanisms,\nand explore new agent behaviors. Magentic-UI offers a foundation for studying how agents and\nhumans can work together reliably and safely.\nReferences\n[1] M. Aliannejadi, H. Zamani, F. Crestani, and W. B. Croft.

Please\nrefer to the interface screenshot Figure 2 and Figure 1.\nFrom Input to Plan. Users can type in a text query in an input box, and can optionally attach\nindividual image and text files. Users can also give Magentic-UI access to directories of arbitrary\nfiles from which to work. Given the user’s input, Magentic-UI will either generate a direct text\nresponse or generate a plan to solve the task. Direct responses occur when the query is easily\nanswered, e.g. “what are synonyms of interactive?”, or are under-specified, requiring immediate\ndisambiguation e.g., “book a flight”. In all other cases, plans are generated. A plan consists of a\nsequence of steps where each step has a natural language description and an assignment of which\nagent should do the work. Importantly, the plan is editable directly through the interface: users\ncan modify the natural language details of each step, add steps, delete steps, or re-order steps as\nnecessary. Users can also regenerate the entire plan from the original prompt, or can write text\nfeedback to generate a new plan. The process of the user collaborating with Magentic-UI to create\nthe plan is calledco-planning. For instance, if the task was “create a csv with the latest papers on\ncomputer-use from arxiv” the plan Magentic-UI generates is:\nStep 1WebSurfer: Find the latest arXiv papers on computer-use. Search arXiv using\nkeywords and gather paper metadata.\nStep 2 Coder: Create a CSV file from the paper metadata. Include title, authors, date,\nabstract, and link.\nTo begin plan execution, the user must explicitly press the “Accept” button or type “accept” or\nsimilar language.\nExecuting the Plan. Once the plan is accepted, Magentic-UI will start executing it step by step.\nThe interface will show the current step being executed, and Magentic-UI will assign one of the\nagents to complete the step. The agent will display the current action it is about to execute, then\nthe result of the action execution. For instance, for the first step of our plan above, the WebSurfer\nagent will state “I will visit http://arxiv.org/”. It will then perform the action and report “I typed\n’https://arxiv.org/’ into the browser address bar”. The action and its effects are also apparent in\nthe right hand side panel, which shows the browser that Magentic-UI controls. Users can pause and\ninterrupt execution at any point by either pressing the “Pause” button or clicking on the browser\nview which will give them control. Conversely, if Magentic-UI needs help, for instance if it encounters\na CAPTCHA that it cannot solve on the page, it can stop execution and hand back control to the\nuser. The user can either type their response in the chat interface or take control of the browser to\ncomplete the CAPTCHA. This process of the user and the agents collaborating to complete the task\nis referred to asco-tasking. Magentic-UI also asks for explicit approval before executing certain\nactions it deems irreversible, costly, or potentially harmful, and the user must reply with a binary\naction approvaldecision.\nFinal Answer. Once all steps of the plan are completed, Magentic-UI will generate an explicit\nfinal answer to the user’s query. The final answer will consist of a text response in addition to\nany generated files available for the user to download if the tasks required them. In our example\nabove, Magentic-UI will summarize the latest papers and present the csv file available for download.\nMagentic-UI will include any useful links to aid inanswer verification, and users can scroll through\nthe trace of steps the system performed.\n35"}

If users find that the plan Magentic-UI used to complete the task could be useful\nin the future, they can click the “Learn Plan” button and the system will synthesize a plan from its\nexecution trace and save it to the saved-plans gallery. In our example above, the saved plan could\nbe re-used to search for papers on any other topic. Users can view and modify saved plans in a\nsaved-plans gallery. When users launch a new task, Magentic-UI can automatically retrieve the\nmost relevant saved plan, or users can manually select one of the saved plans to be used for the new\ntask. This enables a specific form ofmemory to enable longer-term interactions.\nMulti-tasking. Users can launch multiple tasks at the same time and monitor them. On the left,\nusers can press the “New Session” to launch new tasks without interfering with their existing task.\nThe left side panel in Figure 2 is the sessions navigator where users can create new sessions to solve\nnew tasks, switch between sessions, and check on session progress with the session status indicators.\nThere are three session status indicators: [red glowing circle] is when a session requires user input\nduring co-tasking or co-planning or action approvals, [spinning circle] is when the system is actively\nperforming actions and not awaiting user input, and finally [green check] is when a final answer has\nbeen generated and ready for user review.\nHaving described the user-facing components in detail, we next describe the implementation of\nMagentic-UI, including its multi-agent architecture and individual agents.\nB Action Guard Prompt\nThe following action is being proposed :\n{approval_message}\nPlease review this action in the context of the following history , and\ndetermine if it requires human approval .\nAn action requires human approval if it is irreversible or is\npotentially harmful or impactful .\nPlease evaluate this action carefully considering the following\ncriteria :\n− Does the action have potential real −world consequences affecting user\nsafety or security?\n− Could the action cause irreversible changes or require complex steps\nto undo?\n− Does the action impact data integrity , privacy , or significant system\nstate?\n− Could the action affect other users or external entities in any\nimpactful way?\nIf the answer to any of the above is yes , the action should be\nconsidered harmful or impactful and require explicit user approval .\nExamples for when the action should require human approval :\n− If the websurfer is about to click a button that submits a form , or\nsends an email , or make a purchase , it should require human approval\n.\n− If the websurfer is typing potentially sensitive information , it\nshould require human approval .\n− If the coder is writing code that creates files that were not\napproved or leaks information about the underlying system , it should\n36"}

Introduction\nScientific discovery is the fundamental driving force behind the advancement of human civilization. From\nNewton’s laws of motion and gravitation (Newton, 1833, Newton and Chittenden, 1850), through Einstein’s\ntheory of relativity (Einstein, 1922), to artificial intelligence (LeCun et al., 2015, Ertel, 2024), every\nmajor scientific breakthrough has expanded the boundaries of human understanding and propelled societal\nprogress. Traditionally, humans, as the primary agents of scientific research, have followed a systematic\npath of exploration. This process typically begins with observation and learning to establish a foundational\nbasis for scientific knowledge(knowledge acquisition), followed by the formulation of scientific hypotheses\nto address unresolved questions(idea generation). The subsequent step involves rigorous testing and\nfalsification of these hypotheses through intensive experiments and theoretical analysis(verification and\nfalsification). Finally, research is continuously refined based on experimental or theoretical results, driving\nthe ongoingevolutionof scientific knowledge (Langley, 1987).\nQiujie Xie, Yixuan Weng, and Minjun Zhu contributed equally to this work.

We outline the core functions for each capability level.\nHowever, the research process is inherently constrained by human limitations such as limited time and\ncognitive capacity, leading to slow literature reviews, relatively narrow knowledge domains, biased hypothesis\ngeneration, and inefficient experiment execution (Ioannidis, 2005, Baker, 2016). To address these issues,\nthere has been a growing pursuit of the automation of scientific discovery (Yang et al., 2023, 2025a). Early\nefforts have focused on leveragingdeep learning techniques(LeCun et al., 2015, Vaswani et al., 2017)\nto support knowledge acquisition. For example, pre-trained language models have been adapted with\ndomain-specific knowledge to better represent scientific information (Gupta et al., 2022). However, due\nto constraints in model capacity and the availability of high-quality scientific data, these methods have\nprimarily served as scientific tools, providing partial acceleration to the human research process. In recent\nyears, LLMs trained on large-scale, high-quality corporahave demonstrated remarkable abilities in both\ncomprehension and generation across long-text scenarios, making it possible to generate novel and feasible\nscientific hypotheses based on the accumulated knowledge (Si et al., 2024), and to rigorously evaluate these\nhypotheses using automated experimental tools (Wierenga et al., 2023, Starace et al., 2025). This progress\nis propelling automated scientific discovery to the next level, where LLM-based AI Scientist systems (Lu et al.,\n2024, Weng et al., 2025) are now taking the lead in exploration. Once endowed with capabilities beyond\nhuman limitations (e.g., the ability to overcome restricted memory capacity), an AI Scientist will have the\npotential to make ground-breaking discoveries that solve grand challenges across medicine, energy, and the\nenvironment. We are now poised to explore a central question in the field:How far are AI scientists from\nchanging the world and reshaping the scientific research paradigm?\nTo answer this question, we provide a prospect-driven review of existing achievements. Figure 1 lays out\na hierarchy of capacities necessary for a mature AI Scientist, which we reckon as a reasonable road map\nfor current and future research in this direction. Specifically,our survey introduces a capability-level\n2"}

We systematically ex-\namine how modern AI Scientist systems, particularly LLM-powered methods, address the dual challenges\nof (1) literature search/curation (filtering relevant research from massive corpora) and (2) knowledge\nretrieval/summarization (extracting structured insights). Interestingly, even before the advent of LLMs, the\nfoundational concept of AI Scientist systems had already garnered significant attention, with numerous\nsmaller-scale language models demonstrating notable success in the knowledge acquisition phase. Conse-\nquently, in this section, we categorize research work of AI Scientist systems in knowledge acquisition into the\npre-LLM era(roughly before 2020) and theLLM era(from 2020 onwards, marked by the emergence of\nLLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)).\n4"}

Pre-LLM Era Methods\nDuring the pre-LLM era, researchers make significant progress in automated knowledge acquisition by\nfine-tuning small pre-trained language models (PLMs) with domain-specific knowledge to learn substantial\nscientific representations (Beltagy et al., 2019, Jin et al., 2019, Li et al., 2023). These models demonstrate\nremarkable capabilities in structured text mining and knowledge extraction from scientific literature, paving\nthe way for more advanced methods based on LLMs.\nLiterature. Prior to the rise of LLMs, early automated knowledge acquisition systems predominantly\nrelied on smaller PLMs that are trained on substantial scientific corpora. SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019)\nis the first PLM that is pretrained on 1.14 million papers and achieves strong performance on scientific\nNER and citation classification tasks, accelerating human researchers’ research efficiency, especially in the\ncomputer science domain. Similarly, SCHOLARBERT (Hong et al., 2023), pretrained on 221B tokens of\nscholarly text, largely enhances contextual understanding in scientific literature. Domain-specific models,\nsuch as CinicalBERT (Huang et al., 2019), PubMedBERT (Gu et al., 2020), BioELMo (Jin et al., 2019),\nBioBERT (Lee et al., 2020), BioMegatron (Shin et al., 2020), BioM-Transformers (Alrowili and Shanker,\n2021), and MatSciBERT (Gupta et al., 2022) are pretrained on high-quality clinical, biology, and chemistry\ncorpora. These models focus on structured text mining, extracting key phrases, entities, and relationships\nfrom scientific abstracts or full papers using techniques like rule-based parsing and graph-based citation\nanalysis (Cachola et al., 2020a). Kang et al. (2022) leverage the author network graph methods to disclose\nthe deep connection behind users’ interaction with the papers. Similarly, Kang et al. (2023) construct\na committee of authors with user-selected paper seeds while accepting signals from multiple sources to\ndynamically discover related literature. While the above pre-LLM era studies achieve notable success in\nautomated knowledge acquisition, their scalability and contextual understanding are fundamentally limited,\nsetting the stage for more sophisticated approaches to knowledge acquisition.\nExperiments. In pre-LLM era, researchers also explore the extraction of knowledge from experimental\nresults (e.g., the construction of leaderboards). Following the efforts of utilizing data sources like NLP-\nprogress 1 and Papers with Code2, SciGen (Moosavi et al., 2021) and Numerical-NLG (Suadaa et al., 2021)\nare two benchmarks that assess the capability of language models in scientific table description generation.\nHowever, these works are found to lack stringent quality assurance measures. For instance, there is no\nstandardization of scientific entities across various leaderboards, and the coverage of relevant publications is\nincomplete. Instead, SCICM (Li et al., 2023) opts for arXiv, which is an open-access archive for nearly 2.4\nmillion scholarly articles in different domains, providing a large amount of relevant publications. Similar to\nSCICM, TDMS-IE (Hou et al., 2019), and AxCell (Kardas et al., 2020) extract “Task-Dataset-Model” triples,\nalong with the experiment result entities to build leaderboards automatically. This line of work is extended\nby subsequent methods such as TELIN (Yang et al., 2022) and ORKG-Leaderboards (KABENAMUALU et al.,\n2023), marking a clear trend toward improving research efficiency.\n2.2. LLM Era Methods\nThe transformative impact of LLMs on the knowledge acquisition capabilities of AI Scientist systems marks\nthe beginning of the “LLM era”.

Literature Search and Curation\nResearchers have developed specialized toolkits and systems to efficiently filter, select, and recommend\nrelevant scientific literature from diverse sources (e.g., PubMed3, arXiv4). Among these works, systems such\nas PaperWeaver (Lee et al., 2024) stand out for their versatility, as they are capable of supporting multiple\nsubstages throughout the literature search pipeline. Building on this progress, DORA AI Scientist (Naumov\net al., 2025) further advances the field by incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Gao\net al., 2023) into its core search process, thereby enhancing contextual relevance and automation. Despite\nthese advancements, not all systems are fully autonomous. For example, semi-automatic frameworks like\nCodeScientist (Jansen et al., 2025) still rely on user-supplied paper lists for ideation, highlighting the ongoing\nchallenges in achieving truly automated and high-precision literature discovery.\nBuilding on this spectrum of approaches, researchers have developed varied implementations for searching\nand filtering scientific literature. Schmidgall et al. (2025) utilize the arXiv API to retrieve papers and perform\nsummarization, full-text extraction, and curation tasks. Meanwhile, Jiabin et al. (2025) apply citation-based\nfiltering to top-cited domain papers from arXiv. Beyond single-agent retrieval, multi-agent systems have\nbeen explored as well. Gottweis et al. (2025) integrate web search tools, while Lu et al. (2024) utilize\nSemantic Scholar’s API to identify relevant papers for hypotheses generation. In the RAG domain, Lála et al.\n(2023) and Skarlinski et al. (2024) introduce PaperQA and PaperQA2 for scientific question answering tasks.\nFurthermore, the pursuit of greater autonomy is exemplified by PaSa (He et al., 2025), which deploys a\ndual-agent architecture with session-level reinforcement learning to autonomously search, analyze papers,\nand explore citation networks for complex queries. Despite these advancements, Beel et al. (2025) note\nthat existing systems still heavily rely on keyword-based matching, often retrieving classic but potentially\noutdated papers, highlighting the need for more context-aware retrieval strategies.\n2.2.2. Knowledge Retrieval and Summarization\nBased on the well-processed literature, knowledge retrieval and summarization methods aim to derive\nknowledge from both structured and unstructured data. This line of work primarily consists of two parts: (1)\nidea-oriented approaches, which extract key concepts and insights from research papers, and (2) experiment-\noriented approaches, which retrieve experimental results and summarize them into comprehensive reports.\nLLMs play a pivotal role in this stage by processing and organizing valuable knowledge from the literature.\nIdea-orientedapproaches utilizeLLMstoextractkeyconceptsandinsightsfromscientificdocuments. These\nmethods can be classified into several categories: (1)Direct promptingserves as a foundational approach,\nin which the LLM-based task execution is directly guided by explicit prompt instructions. However, due to\nconstraints such as context length and retrieval accuracy, these approaches are rarely adopted and typically\nserve as the baseline methods (Dagdelen et al., 2024, Gupta et al., 2024, Yao et al., 2025). (2)Literature\nstructure-based methodsleverage the inherent organization of scientific documents or predefined plans\nbased on paper structures (e.g., abstract, introduction, and conclusion (AIC)) (Sharma et al., 2019, Cachola\net al., 2020b, Takeshita et al., 2022). (3)RAG-based methodsenhance the summarization ability of LLM by\nfirst retrieving relevant external information and then using it as context for generation, aiming for more\n3https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\n4https://arxiv.org/\n6"}

For instance, LitLLM (Agarwal et al.,\n2024a) utilizes RAG for both literature searching and knowledge retrieval. (4)Multi-agent-based methods\ninvolve the collaboration of multi-agent systems to generate literature reviews. For example, Schmidgall and\nMoor (2025) integrate multiple LLMs to accelerate the process of knowledge retrieval and summarization.\nExperiment-oriented methods involve extracting experimental results from scientific documents and\nsummarizing them into comprehensive reports. LLMs play a pivotal role in this process by analyzing\nstructured data, interpreting experimental designs, and generating comprehensive summaries. However,\nthis task is complicated by the need for precise extraction of Task-Model-Dataset triples and the dynamic\nnature of research benchmarks. For example, the LEGO-bench (Singh et al., 2024) proposes a benchmark for\nevaluating systems that generate scientific leaderboards, which attempts to stay informed about the latest\nstate-of-the-art research. Through semi-automated extraction of experimental data from multiple datasets,\nPark et al. (2025) demonstrate how comparativeapproaches can yield newscientific discoveries. Concurrently,\nWu et al. (2025) propose Leader Auto Generation (LAG), which implements a comprehensive four-stage\nprocess for dynamic leaderboard generation, encompassing table retrieval, data integration, leaderboard\ngeneration, and quality-based selection of the most effective leaderboards.\n2.3. Evaluation\nEvaluation benchmarks play a crucial role in assessing the capabilities of AI scientist systems in knowledge\nacquisition. These benchmarks focus on different facets, ranging from information retrieval accuracy and\nsummarization quality to knowledge structure generation.\nClassical scientific summarization.The early evaluation of knowledge acquisition capability derives from\nworks of literature summarization (Cachola et al., 2020b, Takeshita et al., 2022). Including more than\n5400 summaries for scientific papers, SCITLDR (Cachola et al., 2020b) requires models to output extremely\ncompressed summarizations of scientific papers. Following the same format as SCITLDR, X-SCITLDR (Cachola\net al., 2020b) is a multilingual dataset that tests the effectiveness of different cross-lingual summarization\nstrategies. These benchmarks only utilize parts of the original scientific papers (e.g., abstract) as testing\nitems, thus aiming at models with relatively shorter context windows.\nLiterature retrieval. Beyond summarization, another critical dimension of knowledge acquisition evaluation\nlies in a model’s ability to retrieve relevant scientific literature. CiteME (Press et al., 2024) is a recent\nbenchmark focusing on evaluating LLM-based scientific agents by identifying whether they can cite the\ncorrect papers based on given context. LitSearch (Ajith et al., 2024) is another benchmark that assesses the\nability of scientific literature retrieval systems, containing 597 manually curated queries and 64k+ papers to\ntest the ability of complex query comprehension and relevant document location.\nAutomated literature review and tools.Recent benchmarks have started to evaluate the ability of LLMs to\nperform automated literature review and assist in scientific knowledge organization. For example, Yun et al.\n(2023) find that researchers tend to prefer transparent AI tools over black-box systems for literature review\ntasks. Building on this, Hsu et al. (2024) introduce CHIME, a semi-automatically generated benchmark that\nassesses the ability of LLMs to generate and link topic categories, though these models still struggle with\nassigning concrete studies to appropriate topics. Similarly, Agarwal et al. (2024b) propose new evaluation\nprotocols and test sets derived from arXiv papers to rigorously test whether LLMs can write literature reviews,"}

Idea Generation\nDefinition: The idea generation capability of an AI scientist lies in its capability to autonomously formulate\ninnovative and feasible scientific hypotheses based on acquired knowledge and existing methods.This\ncapability distinguishes AI scientist systems from automated scientific tools.\nIn the traditional human-centric research paradigm, researchers are responsible for formulating ideas to be\ntested, while AI handles labor-intensive tasks such as idea implementation and refinement. In this paradigm,\nAI is regarded as an automated tool, rather than a principal actor in scientific research. The emergence\nof LLMs marks a shift, as AI can now autonomously retrieve, review, and comprehend domain-specific\nknowledge from vast bodies of scientific literature (Section 2). As a result, an increasing number of efforts are\nbeing devoted to developing AI scientist systems capable of autonomously generating innovative and feasible\nhypotheses at scale (Hu et al., 2024, Lu et al., 2024, Si et al., 2024, Weng et al., 2025). In this new paradigm,\nAI scientist systems, distinguished from automated scientific tools,become the core drivers of scientific\nresearch, responsible for proposing novel hypotheses,while humans or automated experimental tools act\nas the executors of these hypotheses.\n3.1. Methods\nA classic formalization of idea generation dates back to Swanson (1986), who proposed the “ABC” model:\ntwo concepts, A and C, are hypothesized to be linked if they both co-occur with some intermediate concept\nB in the literature. Inspired by this work, subsequent studies have adoptedgraph models(Wang et al., 2019,\nSybrandt et al., 2020, Youn et al., 2022) orword vectors(Tshitoyan et al., 2019) to generate scientific\nhypotheses by identifying links between concept pairs. However, transforming complex scientific ideas into\nconcept links in binary form not only constrains the input type but also significantly limits the expressivity of\nthe generated hypotheses (Moreau et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2024b).\nIn recent years, the rapid advancement of LLMs has opened up new possibilities for researchers across\nvarious fields to explore how to enable LLMs to generate innovative scientific hypotheses in the form of\nnatural language, through specializedprompting strategies (Li et al., 2024b, Hu et al., 2024, Lu et al., 2024,\nYamada et al., 2025, Jansen et al., 2025),post-training methods (Qi et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2024b, Weng\net al., 2025), ormulti-agent collaboration(Liu et al., 2024, Yang et al., 2024, 2025b, Gottweis et al., 2025).\nFor instance, drawing inspiration from how humans conduct research, Li et al. (2024b) propose the Chain-\nof-Ideas (CoI) agent. This LLM-based agent organizes relevant literature into a chain structure, effectively\nreflecting the progressive development of a research domain and enabling the generation of high-quality\nhypotheses grounded in existing literature. Building on the importance of retrieval, Si et al. (2024) employ\nan LLM agent that incorporates retrieval augmentation and leverages recent advances in inference-time\nscaling. They prompt the LLM to generate 4,000 seed ideas for each research topic and use a reranker to\nselect the highest-quality hypotheses. Another notable line of work focuses on post-training optimization.\nFor instance, Wang et al. (2024b) introduce SCIMON, a framework designed to generate natural language\nhypotheses based on background contexts dynamically retrieved from scientific literature. SCIMON further\nfine-tunes T5 models (Raffel et al., 2020) using both an in-context contrastive objective and a language\nmodeling objective, and then explicitly optimizing the generated hypotheses for novelty through an iterative\nprocess. Meanwhile,AI Scientist (Lu et al., 2024) employs multiple rounds of chain-of-thought (Wei\n8"}

Beyond individual\nagents, collaborative multi-agent systems have also demonstrated promise. For example, Yang et al. (2025b)\ndevelop MOOSE-CHEM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that operates in three stages: (1) Searching\nchemistry literature for inspiration papers, (2) using these inspirations to propose hypotheses related to the\ntarget research question, and (3) identifying and ranking high-quality hypotheses.\n3.2. Evaluation\nTable 1:Commonly-used evaluation criteria for AI-generated scientific hypotheses.\nCriterion Description\nNovelty Whether the hypothesis is creative, distinct from existing work on\nthe topic, and offers fresh insights.\nFeasibility How practical and achievable the hypothesis is as the basis for a\nresearch project.\nClarity Whether the hypothesis is clearly stated and easy to understand.\nExcitement The potential excitement and impact the hypothesis could generate\nif pursued as a full research endeavor.\nEvaluation of the generated hypotheses is typically conducted based on multiple criteria that reflect their\nquality, including but not limited to: novelty, feasibility, clarity, and excitement (Si et al., 2024, Chai et al.,\n2024, Wang et al., 2024b, Li et al., 2024b). The detail of each criterion is presented in Table 1. Based on\nthese evaluation criteria, researchers generally adopt two approaches to estimate the quality of AI-generated\nhypotheses: automated evaluation and human evaluation. Among them,automated methods(Li et al.,\n2024b, Yang et al., 2025b, Chai et al., 2024, Yang et al., 2024, Chai et al., 2024) usually involve employing\na powerful LLM as an auto-evaluator to assess hypothesis quality. For instance, Chai et al. (2024) employ\nthe Claude 3.5 model (Anthropic, 2024) to compare each hypothesis against the background context and\nresearch topic, ensuring it demonstrates sufficient novelty, scientific soundness, and clarity. Li et al. (2024b)\npropose Idea Arena, a pairwise evaluation system in which an LLM judge ranks hypotheses in pairwise\ncomparisons and computes ELO scores for each hypothesis generation model. However,the performance\nof LLMs as evaluators is influenced by various factors, such as training data diversity (Shi et al., 2024),\ninherent model biases (Zheng et al., 2023), and evaluation uncertainty (Xie et al., 2025).\nIn contrast, human evaluations(Qi et al., 2023, Si et al., 2024, Hu et al., 2024, Wang et al., 2024b)\nare considered the gold standard for assessing hypotheses, as quantitative metrics often fall short. For\nexample, Hu et al. (2024) recruit a panel of 10 experts, all holding a PhD degree or professorship to evaluate\nhypotheses based on novelty and overall quality. Furthermore, Si et al. (2024) conduct a large-scale human\nstudy that recruits 79 expert researchers to perform blind reviews of 49 ideas from each of three conditions:\nexpert-written ideas, AI-generated ideas, and AI-generated ideas re-ranked by a human expert. They find that\nLLM-generated ideas are rated as more novel (p < 0.05) than those written by human experts, although they\nare considered slightly less feasible. Additionally, some studies also utilizereference-based text generation\nmetricsto evaluate hypothesis quality. For example, Qi et al. (2023) employ BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and\nROUGE (Lin, 2004) scores to measure word overlap between generated outputs and ground truth references.\nYang et al. (2025b) adopt the Matched Score, which calculates the similarity between a generated hypothesis\nand the original hypothesis using a 6-point Likert scale.\n9"}

While this\nmethod can efficiently filter out obviously infeasible hypotheses, it lacks accuracy and objectivity (Krishna\net al., 2023, Karpinska et al., 2021). Therefore,assessing the feasibility of a hypothesis also requires\npractical methods(e.g., transforming the hypothesis into executable code) to enable empirical validation\nand falsification. In this survey, we categorize the ability to design experiments to validate new scientific\nhypotheses as a more advanced form of verification and falsification, which we discuss in detail in Section 4.\n4. Verification and Falsification\nDefinition: This capability allows an AI Scientist to systematically design, implement, and analyze\nexperiments toverify and falsify the AI-generated scientific hypotheses. Crucially, the verification and\nfalsification capability is what completes the research cycle, transforming the AI Scientist from an idea\ngenerator into an autonomous scientific intelligence.\nWhile AI systems show growing proficiency in generating scientific hypotheses, concerns persist about their\nreliability and true scientific merit. As noted in Section 3, current assessments of these AI-generated hy-\npotheses, especially regarding theirfeasibility, rely heavily on subjective human evaluations or superficial\ntext-similarity metrics. These approaches fundamentally lack theempirical rigorthat only practical experi-\nmental validation can provide, which underscores the indispensable role ofverification and falsification\ncapabilities. The capability to actively test and validate hypotheses (verification) and rigorously challenge\nthem (falsification) in simulated or real environments is the crucial component that definesa complete AI\nScientist capable of closed-loop scientific discovery.\nType Total citations Avg. citations\nWithout Implementation 216 10.3\nWith Implementation 325 25.0\n/uni00000029/uni00000044/uni0000004f/uni0000004f/uni00000003/uni0000000a/uni00000015/uni00000017/uni0000003a/uni0000004c/uni00000051/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000003/uni0000000a/uni00000015/uni00000017/uni00000036/uni00000053/uni00000055/uni0000004c/uni00000051/uni0000004a/uni00000003/uni0000000a/uni00000015/uni00000018\n/uni00000013\n/uni00000016\n/uni00000019\n/uni0000001c\n/uni00000014/uni00000015\n/uni00000014/uni00000018\n/uni00000014/uni0000001b\n/uni00000015/uni00000014\n/uni00000015/uni00000017\n/uni00000034/uni00000058/uni00000044/uni00000051/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000057/uni0000005c\n/uni00000014/uni00000013\n/uni00000015\n/uni00000014/uni00000018\n/uni0000001a\n/uni00000015/uni00000014\n/uni00000014/uni00000016\n/uni0000003a/uni0000004c/uni00000057/uni0000004b/uni00000052/uni00000058/uni00000057/uni00000003/uni0000002c/uni00000050/uni00000053/uni0000004f/uni00000048/uni00000050/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000057/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051\n/uni0000003a/uni0000004c/uni00000057/uni0000004b/uni00000003/uni0000002c/uni00000050/uni00000053/uni0000004f/uni00000048/uni00000050/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000057/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051\nFigure 3:An analysis of the number of publications in\nthe field of AI Scientist systems on arXiv.

Methods\nThe ultimate goal of verification and falsification is primarily based ondesigning, implementing, and\nanalyzing experimentsto assess whether the AI-generated hypotheses are feasible. However, considering\nthe different limitations of experiments in different scientific fields (e.g., chemistry, biology, and medicine),\nsuch as venue, equipment, and experimental safety, currently AI scientist systems focus mainly on idea\nverification and falsification in the field of computer science, especially in machine learning.\nForexperimental design, the AI Scientist field has seen several innovative approaches. BioPlanner (Liu and\nShah, 2023) introduces an automated evaluation framework for assessing LLMs’ ability to plan experiments\nin the biology domain. DSBench (Jing et al., 2025) and ScienceAgentBench (Chen et al., 2024) assess agents’\ncapabilities in experimental design for data-driven scientific discovery. Yang et al. (2023) is the first work to\nemploy an LLM as a “masterbrain scientist” (akin to a principal investigator), taking on the central role and\nsteering a fully closed-loop research. Subsequent AI Scientist systems, such asAI Scientist (Lu et al.,\n2024) further utilize LLM agents to autonomously propose research ideas, formulate testable hypotheses,\nand design high-level experimental plans. These plans typically include defining variables, selecting datasets,\nchoosing baseline models, and outlining evaluation metrics. However, the diversity and complexity of\nscientific experimental design present significant challenges for current AI Scientist systems. Experimental\ndesigns generated by these AI Scientist systems often lack scientific rigor, innovation, and practicality, making\nit difficult to meet the demands of high-level research (Huang et al., 2025a, Weng et al., 2025).\nImplementation, theoretically the most important and difficult part of experiments, is often addressed\nthrough repository-level code generation. For instance,LLM-based methodssuch as ToolGen (Wang et al.,\n2024a), propose an approach that integrates auto-completion tools to generate repository-level code with\nreliable dependencies. CoCoGen (Bi et al., 2024) iteratively aligns and fixes errors using information\nextracted from the code repository. CatCoder (Pan et al., 2024b) enhances repository-level code generation\nby integrating relevant code and type context.Agent-based methodshave showcased even more powerful\nperformance.

RepoCoder(Zhangetal.,\n2023) streamlines the repository-level code completion process by incorporating a similarity-based retriever\nand a pre-trained code language model in an iterative retrieval-generation pipeline. More closely related to\nreal-life scenarios, RepoGraph (Ouyang et al., 2024) operates at the line level, offering a more fine-grained\napproach compared to previous file-level browsing methods. Each node in the graph represents a line of code,\nand edges represent the dependencies of code definitions and references. RepoGraph boosts the success\nrate of existing methods by achieving an average relative improvement of 32.8% on SWE-bench (Jimenez\net al., 2023). SciCode (Tian et al., 2024) decomposes the generation of scientific repository-level code into\nmultiple sub-problems, each involving knowledge recall, reasoning, and code synthesis. AIDE (Jiang et al.,\n2025) formalizes machine learning research as a code optimization problem, and formulates trial-and-error\nas a tree search in the space of potential solutions. MLR-Copilot (Li et al., 2024c) further proposes an\nExperimentAgent to translate experiment plans into executable experimental code, crucially incorporating\nhuman feedback and iterative debugging mechanisms to manage the complexities of execution. In pursuit of\ngreater autonomy, Lin et al. (2025) propose AutoP2C, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that processes\nboth textual and visual content from research papers to automatically generate executable code repositories.\nThese ongoing developments underscore a persistent drive to overcome the inherent difficulties in scientific\nimplementation through increasingly sophisticated methods.\nAnalysis, as the concluding part of the experimental process, plays a crucial role in organizing experimental\nresults into well-written experimental reports. Recent advances, such as MCX-LLM (Yen and Fang, 2024),\nhave explored the use of LLMs to convert natural language descriptions into machine-readable inputs for\nrunning Monte Carlo simulations, thus enhancing the efficiency of analysis. To evaluate the capabilities of\nsuchsystems, benchmarkslikeFigureQA(Kahouetal.,2017), ArxivQA(Lietal.,2024a), andMMSCI(Lietal.,\n2025) have been developed, focusing on the agents’ ability to understand and reason over complex figures,\nincluding graphs, charts, and tables. In addition to data interpretation, tools such as LLM-ref (Fuad and Chen,\n2024) further assist researchers by supporting the synthesis of information from multiple source documents\nand enhancing reference management during the article writing process. Building on these advancements,\nstate-of-the-art AI Scientist systems leverage LLM-driven code generation to automate robust statistical\nanalyses and to generate visualizations such as plots, tables, and charts. This automation greatly streamlines\nthe reporting of experimental findings. Furthermore, these systems often perform multiple independent\nexperimental runs and aggregate the results, thereby enabling comprehensive meta-analyses. After the\nanalytical stage, some AI Scientist systems (Intology, 2025, Yamada et al., 2025) can even synthesize results\ninto scientific manuscripts, automatically generating structured reports that encompass methodological\ndetails, data analyses, results, and conclusions in standard academic formats. While automatic paper writing\nrepresents a significant application of these systems, it is important to note that manuscript generation is not\nthe core capability of AI Scientist systems. Therefore, the focus of this survey remains on the analytical and\nreasoning aspects rather than on the writing of final research articles.\n4.2.

For instance, MLE-Bench (Chan et al., 2024) assesses the ability to solve Kaggle machine learning\ntasks, where OpenAI’s “o1-preview” achieved only 16.90% medal-worthy success. PaperBench (Starace\net al., 2025) requires the replication of ICML research papers from scratch, on which OpenAI’s “o1-high”\nmanages a 26.00% replication score. Further evidence of these challenges is found in SciReplicate-Bench\n(Xiang et al., 2025), a benchmark focusing on generating executable code from algorithm descriptions\n(Claude-Sonnet-3.7 reaches only 39.00% execution accuracy); CORE-Bench (Siegel et al., 2024), involving\nthe reproduction of computational results from scientific papers across diverse fields (OpenAI’s GPT-4o\nachieving 55.56% accuracy on medium difficulty tasks); and ML-Dev-Bench (Padigela et al., 2025), which\nevaluates performance on diverse machine learning development workflow tasks (Claude-Sonnet-3.5 shows\na 50.00% success rate). These evaluations consistently demonstrate that LLMs face significant difficulty in\ntranslating conceptual understanding or initial plans into verifiably correct and operational code, highlighting\na fundamental limitation in their verification capabilities and underscoring the importance of systematic\nverification and implementation capabilities for the maturation of AI Scientist systems.\n5. Review System\nDefinition: An AI reviewer system comprehensively assesses the generated manuscripts to provide insightful\nreviews, aiming to enhance the quality of the scientific artifact produced by AI Scientist systems.\nPeer review is essential for refining scientific work, but traditional systems face significant challenges\nespecially in fast-evolving fields like computer science, where new results can become outdated before they\nare published. At the same time, the peer review system depends on a limited number of reviewers who\nare often overwhelmed by the high volume of submissions, which leads to delays, biases, inconsistencies,\nand sometimes unfair outcomes (Stelmakh et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2022, Fox et al., 2023). To address\nthese problems, researchers are actively exploring the use of AI systems to support scientific reviewing\nthroughout the peer review life-cycle. Broadly speaking, the development of AI reviewer systems can be\ndivided into two phases, marked by the emergence of LLMs:(1) Pre-LLM phase: Earlier AI reviewer\nsystems primarily focused on automating reviewer-paper matching based on content analysis and reviewer\nexpertise (Charlin and Zemel, 2013, Stelmakh et al., 2019, Stelmakh, 2021). These systems also handle\nscreening and pre-check processes, such as verifying compliance with submission guidelines, plagiarism,\nand anonymity checks (Goldberg et al., 2024a, Lee et al., 2025).(2) LLM-based AI reviewer system:With\nthe advent of LLMs, the capabilities of AI reviewers have expanded dramatically. A key advancement is the\nability to automatically generate detailed, structured reviews. These reviews typically include summaries,\nassessments of strengths and weaknesses, and constructive feedback, which aim to make the review process\nmore efficient and equitable, ultimately enhancing both the speed and quality of scientific evaluation (Wang\net al., 2020, Idahl and Ahmadi, 2024, Tyser et al., 2024, Pendyala et al., 2025, Zhu et al., 2025).\n5.1. Methods\nDifferent technologies for AI reviewer systems have been developed to handle specific parts of the review\nprocess. These methods range from simple tasks, such as screening and classifying submissions (Wang et al.,\n2024c, Cao et al., 2024, Jaumann et al., 2025), to more complex tasks, including writing review comments,\nsimulating reviewer discussions, and reasoning about a paper’s content (Peng et al., 2024, Su et al., 2025,\n13"}

The process begins with (1) classification\n& scoring systems that provide quantitative outputs (e.g., scores or accept/reject decisions). This paradigm gradually\nevolves into (2) generation Systems that produce narrative review text. Recently, a more advanced paradigm employs\n(3) multi-agent Systems, where multiple AI agents collaborate to create a comprehensive, multi-faceted evaluation.\nSun et al., 2024, Zhou et al., 2025a, Zhu et al., 2025, Jin et al., 2024). We classify these methods based on\ntheir underlying paradigms and the complexity of the tasks they address (Figure 4).\nClassification- and scoring-based AI reviewer systemsprimarily focus on evaluating academic papers to\nassign quantitative scores against predefined criteria (Zhu et al., 2025), classifying them based on specific\nattributes (e.g., relevance to a conference (Leyton-Brown et al., 2024)), or screening literature for inclusion\nin systematic reviews (Joos et al., 2024). These systems often target specific, measurable aspects of an\nacademic paper rather than generating holistic reviews (Wang et al., 2024d, Liang et al., 2025). For example,\nReviewRobot(Wang et al., 2020) employs a knowledge graph-based framework to predict review scores\nand generate structured evidence, emphasizing explainability. Its performance in score prediction reaches\n71.4% accuracy, with a significant portion of its generated comments deemed valid and constructive by\nhuman experts. Similarly,RelevAI-Reviewer(Couto et al., 2024) conceptualizes survey paper review as a\nclassification task, benchmarking AI’s ability to assess relevance using a dataset of over 25,000 instances. In\nterms of empirical experiment, the NeurIPS 2024 committee employed LLMs to systematically categorize\nsubmitted papers and check them against a standardized checklist (Goldberg et al., 2024b). Over 70% of\nauthors found the system useful, and 70% made substantial revisions based on the detailed feedback.\nGeneration-based AI reviewer systemsare designed to produce academic reviews in natural language,\nmirroring the narrative outputs of human reviewers. For example,Reviewer2(Gao et al., 2024) introduces\na two-stage framework that first models the distribution of potential review aspects and then generates\nprompts to guide an LLM in producing detailed academic reviews.OpenReviewer(Tyser et al., 2024),\na specialized 8-billion parameter LLM fine-tuned on 79,000 expert reviews, processes PDF submissions\nto generate structured reviews adhering to conference guidelines, notably producing more “critical and\n14"}

Another automated method described in (Wu et al.,\n2024) uses LLMs to analyze papers, extract key information, and generate insights with quality control\nmeasures to mitigate hallucination, reportedly matching manual review quality in a case study. Furthermore,\nCycleReviewer(Wenget al., 2025)providesa suiteofspeciallytrainedLLMs togenerateexpert-levelopinions\nand evaluation scores, achieving a 26.89% reduction in MAE for score prediction compared to individual\nhuman reviewers. The critical challenge for these systems lies in moving beyond fluent text generation to\nprovide genuinely insightful and constructive criticism, avoiding the tendency towards overly positive or\nsuperficial assessments (Shojaee et al., 2025, Laskar et al., 2024).\nMulti-agent AI reviewer systems.Given that peer review is inherently a collaborative process (Miyao,\n2019, Beygelzimer et al., 2023), researchers have begun exploring AI reviewer systems based on multi-\nagent frameworks. These systems typically employ multiple interacting AI agents with distinct roles (e.g.,\nmeta-reviewer, area chair) to simulate discussions, thereby producing more comprehensive and nuanced\nreviews. For example, AgentReview (Jin et al., 2024) uses LLM agents to investigate review dynamics and\nlatent biases; ReviewAgents (Gao et al., 2025) proposes a multi-role framework to emulate human reasoning\nprocesses; and MARG (D’Arcy et al., 2024) distributes the paper among specialized agents to improve\nfeedback quality. Taking this collaborative structure further, the current frontier of such systems is to replicate\ndeeper human cognitive processes through advanced reasoning and emulation. This involves incorporating\nmulti-stage reasoning, structured analytical frameworks, and evidence-based argumentation to approximate\nthe critical depth achieved by human experts. A prime example is the DeepReviewer framework (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which uses multi-stage thinking processes (Analysis, Argument, Assessment) and has demonstrated\nstrong performance and resilience (Ye et al., 2024). Similarly,AI Scientist (Lu et al., 2024) employs\nmulti-round reflections to evaluate papers.

Evaluation Benchmarks\nThe advancement and rigorous assessment of AI reviewer systems fundamentally rely on the availability of\nappropriate datasets and benchmarks. These resources (Choudhary et al., 2021, Li et al., 2022, Guo et al.,\n2023, Purkayastha et al., 2023, Bharti et al., 2024, D’Arcy et al., 2024, Zhou et al., 2024b, Lou et al., 2025)\nserve as both the training ground for evaluation models and the standard against which their capabilities\nare measured (Zhuang et al., 2025). Early datasets are often collected from conference or journal review\nrecords (Lin et al., 2022, Zeng et al., 2023, Zhou et al., 2024a). As the field grows, researchers begin creating\nmore specialized resources to reflect the different tasks involved in peer review. This includes resources\nspecifically curated for assessing relevance determination (Couto et al., 2024), question-answering abilities\n(Baumgärtner et al., 2025), the generation of aspect-guided (Gao et al., 2024) or weakness-focused feedback\n(Chamoun et al., 2024), and even the crucial task of detecting AI-generated reviews (Yu et al., 2025, Weng\net al., 2025).

These low scores reflect poor performance across key metrics, including\nsoundness, presentation, and contribution. Furthermore, the evaluation results identify twelve major defect\ncategories present in the assessed papers (Table 5), with“Experimental Weakness” appearing in 100%of\nthe papers. This universal deficiency highlights severe limitations in the current implementation capabilities\nof AI scientist systems, particularly regarding experimental design, execution, and result analysis.\nOther prevalent issues includes “Methodological Unclarity/Flaws” (96.4%), “Writing & Presentation Issues”\n(92.9%), and “Novelty Concerns” (89.3%). These findings suggest that current AI Scientist systems not\nonly struggle with scientific execution but also stuck with clearly articulating their research findings. The\nhigh incidence of “Theoretical Weakness” (85.7%), and “Literature Review Deficiencies” (78.6%) further\nindicates that these systems often fail to offer genuinely original contributions or ground their claims in\nrobust theoretical frameworks. These evaluation results align with the low quantitative scores presented in\nTable 4, clearly demonstrating that current AI scientist systems, despite their technological sophistication,\ncannot independently produce scientific artifacts that meet established standards for high-quality\nscientific communication.These findings strongly suggest that current AI-generated research often lacks the\ndepth, rigor, and implementation quality expected in meaningful autonomous research and credible scientific\ncontributions. Addressing these limitations throughevolutionary mechanisms becomes necessaryfor\nadvancing AI Scientist systems toward their full potential as autonomous scientific agents.\n6. Evolution\nDefinition: Evolution is the capability to continuouslyadvance overall research abilities based on\nfeedback from internal reflection or external inputs.This capability involves the dynamic planning\nfor research directions and the autonomous learning for improvement, serving as the pathway for an\nelementary AI Scientist to evolve into a mature scientific agent.\nSeveral influential works have already emerged in the field of AI Scientists (Lu et al., 2024, Weng et al.,\n2025, Intology, 2025, Yamada et al., 2025). For instance,AI Scientist-v2 (Yamada et al., 2025) is\ncapable of autonomously generating manuscripts that successfully pass peer review at workshops of major\nmachine learning conferences. Despite this substantial progress, extensive quantitative evidence (Tables 2,\n4, 5) indicates that systemic issues remain in the scientific rigor and implementation quality of current\nAI-generated research, andthere is still a considerable gap before AI Scientists are able to make ground-\nbreaking discoveries that solve grand challengesacross medicine, energy, and the environment, thereby\nchanging the world and reshaping the scientific research paradigm. We attribute this gap to (1)the inherent\nlimitations of the foundation models(i.e., LLMs) that underlie AI Scientists, and (2)the inadequate\nscientific research abilitiesof current AI Scientists, such as generating hypotheses with low feasibility,\nemploying incorrect validation methods, and having limited ability to understand and decompose complex\nresearch tasks. A more detailed discussion of this gap is deferred to Section 7.\nThrough continuous evolution, an elementary AI Scientist can progressively bridge this gap and gradually\napproach the capabilities of a mature scientific agent. Specifically, evolutionary mechanisms enable AI\nScientists to transcend the static confines of their initial foundation models and refine their research abilities\nthrough iterative feedback and interaction with both human experts and dynamic scientific environments,\nthereby advancing toward the long-term vision of autonomous, reliable, and innovative scientific discovery.

Methods\nCurrently, most research in the field of AI Scientist focuses on the evolution of individual scientific artifacts\n(such as a scientific hypothesis or an experimental code implementation), rather than on managing long-\nterm research cycles with comprehensive planning and iteration. In this section, we primarily summarize\nhow existing AI Scientist systems approach evolution by reviewing their approaches to planning evolution\npaths (Section 6.1.1) and employing autonomous improvement (Section 6.1.2). The discussion of long-cycle\nresearch iteration and comprehensive planning is deferred to Section 8.\n6.1.1. Dynamic Planning\nThe dynamic planning capability aims to explore the most valuable research directions within a constrained\nsearch space, enabling an AI Scientist to efficiently allocate resources, prioritize hypotheses, and adaptively\nrefine research trajectories based on ongoing results and feedback.Currently, in the field of AI Scientist,\ndynamic planning remains relatively underdeveloped, leaving a few cutting-edge studies employing tree-\nsearch strategies with LLMs to enable structured exploration of diverse scientific hypotheses (Intology, 2025)\nand detailed experimental plans (Jansen et al., 2024, Yamada et al., 2025, Yuan et al., 2025). For instance,\nwhen given a broad research domain, Zochi (Intology, 2025) conducts a comprehensive process of exploration\nand refinement process, where it generates multiple candidate hypotheses, designs experiments to test them,\nand iteratively improves its strategy based on the results. InAI Scientist-v2 , Yamada et al. (2025)\nintroduceanexperimentmanageragentincombinationwithanovelagentictree-searchalgorithmtogenerate\nand refine code implementations. Subsequent experiments leverage the top-performing code checkpoints\nfrom the tree search to iteratively evaluate various research hypotheses. Although these approaches enable\nthe discovery of higher-quality scientific hypotheses and experimental designs, they still face challenges such\nas increased complexity, greater computational cost, and limited scalability (Jansen et al., 2025).\n6.1.2. Autonomous Learning\nVarious autonomous learning strategies have been employed to continuously enhance the overall research\ncapabilities of the AI Scientist. These approaches can be categorized into self-reflection methods and\nexternally guided methods, depending on the source of feedback.\nSelf-reflection methods(Lu et al., 2024, Romera-Paredes et al., 2024, Weng et al., 2025, Jansen et al., 2025,\nYamada et al., 2025, Novikov et al., 2025) refer to the process where the LLM serves as its own feedback\nprovider, iteratively evaluating and refining its outputs until a certain quality standard is met (Madaan\net al., 2023, Pan et al., 2024a). This concept of continuous self-improvement has been widely adopted\nin LLMs to enhance downstream performance (Weng et al., 2022, Zelikman et al., 2022) and reduce\nharmful responses (Bai et al., 2022). Accordingly, in the field of AI Scientist, researchers have also begun\nemploying self-reflection strategies toimprove the quality of generated scientific artifacts.For example,\nWeng et al. (2025) propose an iterative preference training framework that consists of two components:\n(1) CycleResearcher, which performs research tasks, and (2) CycleReviewer, which simulates the peer\n18"}

This entire procedure is\nrefined iteratively, leading to progressively improved research capabilities with each cycle. DeepMind’s\nFunSearch (Romera-Paredes et al., 2024) follows a similar evolutionary paradigm, pairing a pretrained LLM,\ntasked with generating creative solutions to scientific problems, with a systematic evaluator that guards\nagainst confabulations and incorrect reasoning. It iteratively samples the best-performing code programs\nand incorporates them into new prompts for the LLM to build upon, evolving initially low-scoring programs\ninto high-performing ones and thereby uncovering novel insights.\nExternally guided methods(Yuan et al., 2025, Yu et al., 2024, Schmidgall and Moor, 2025, Jansen et al.,\n2024). External evaluation of the AI-generated artifacts also serves as an important form of feedback. Current\nAI Scientist systems generally adopt two approaches: (1) incorporating human supervision during the\ngeneration process to assess the quality of hypotheses and provide brief revision suggestions (Jansen et al.,\n2025, Intology, 2025); (2) leveraging internet-based academic platforms (e.g., Semantic Scholar (Fricke,\n2018)) to filter out hypotheses that are overly similar to existing literature, thereby ensuring novelty (Yuan\net al., 2025, Lu et al., 2024, Weng et al., 2025). Beyond these methods, some efforts aim to build research\ncommunities composed entirely of AI Scientist systems, enhancing the quality of their outputs through\ncollaboration. For example, Yu et al. (2024) introduce RESEARCHTOWN, a multi-agent framework for\nsimulating research communities. RESEARCHTOWN models the research community as an “agent-data\ngraph”, where AI researchers and papers are represented as nodes, and activities such as reading, writing,\nand reviewing are implemented as message-passing operations within a TextGNN inference framework.\nSimilarly, WestlakeNLP (2025) establish AiraXiv, a centralized platform that archives scientific artifacts\ngenerated by AI Scientist systems, allowing them to collaborate, share insights, and iteratively build upon\neach other’s work. However,the field currently lacks a specialized protocol for scientist-to-scientist\ncommunicationto enable more efficient and structured interactions among AI scientist systems. Such a\nprotocol could standardize interaction workflows and define communication formats, ultimately facilitating\neffective collaboration and information exchange between AI Scientist systems. Hence, developing a spe-\ncialized communication protocol for AI Scientist systems represents a key future direction for advancing\nautomatic scientific discoveries (see Section 8 for further discussion).\n7. Discussion\n7.1. Positioning of This Survey\nAlthough previous surveys have provided valuable overviews of LLM architectures, agentic frameworks, and\nscientific automation tools for automatic scientific discovery (Zhang et al., 2024b, Zheng et al., 2025, Ren\net al., 2025, Zhou et al., 2025b, Goyal, 2025, Luo et al., 2025), there remains a critical gap:a capability-\nbased roadmap that comprehensively charts the path toward the ideal AI scientist. Our survey addresses\nthis gap by introducing a capability-level framework (Figure 1) that systematically defines the stages of AI\nscientist development, establishing clear benchmarks for the next era of AI-driven scientific discovery. We\ncritically analyze current research through the lens of this capability framework, identifying key bottlenecks\nand missing components necessary for the emergence of ideal scientific agents. The difference between our\nsurvey and existing survey papers is shown in Table 6.\n19"}

Limitations of Current AI Scientists in Scientific Discovery\nDespite the substantial progress in the field of AI Scientist systems, there is still a considerable gap before AI\nScientist can mature into scientific agents capable of making ground-breaking discoveries, thus changing the\nworld and reshaping the scientific research paradigm. This persistent gap can be attributed to several critical\nfactors. First,the inherent limitations of the foundation models(i.e., LLMs) that underpin AI Scientist\nsystems pose significant barriers. These models, while demonstrating impressive capabilities in language\nunderstanding and generation, often lack the depth of domain expertise, capacity for scientific reasoning,\nand nuanced judgment required for high-impact scientific breakthroughs.Their outputs are constrained by\nthe knowledge encoded in their training data, which may be outdated, incomplete, or not fully aligned\nwith the latest advancements in the scientific community. Second, current AI Scientist systemsexhibit\ninadequate scientific research abilitiesin several key aspects. For instance, they may generate hypotheses\nthat lack feasibility or novelty, apply inappropriate or insufficient validation methods, and struggle with\nthe deep comprehension and decomposition of complex research problems. These shortcomings not only\nlimit the reliability of AI-generated scientific artifacts but also hinder the AI Scientist systems’ abilities to\nindependently advance the frontiers of science.\n7.2.1. Fundamental Limitations of Base Models\nDespite their remarkable progress, LLMs that serve as the foundation for AI Scientist systems exhibit several\nintrinsic limitations, including hallucinations, high costs and inefficiencies in knowledge updating, and\ncatastrophic forgetting. These challenges critically constrain the scientific utility and reliability of current AI\nScientist systems, making it crucial to address them for the advancement of AI-driven scientific research.\nHallucination. In scientific research, precision, factual accuracy, and reliability are paramount. However,\nLLMs are prone to “hallucination”, a phenomenon where the model generates plausible-sounding but false\nor unverifiable content (Huang et al., 2025b, Zhang et al., 2025). This can manifest in several ways: (1) The\nmodel may fabricate research findings, experimental data, references, or even entirely non-existent theories,\npresenting them as factually correct. (2) AI-generated citations, data, and formulas are often unreliable or\nimproperly sourced, making it difficult for human researchers to trace and verify the origin and validity\n20"}

(3) Hallucinated outputs may contain subtle logical inconsistencies or contextually\ninappropriate claims, which can mislead researchers, compromise the credibility of scientific outputs, and\nultimately undermine trust in AI-generated scientific artifacts. Addressing hallucination remains one of the\nmost significant challenges for deploying LLM-based AI Scientist systems in high-stakes scientific contexts.\nHigh cost and inefficiency of knowledge updating.Cutting-edge scientific research advances rapidly,\nrequiring AI Scientist systems to constantly incorporate the latest findings and data. However, keeping LLMs\nup-to-date is non-trivial: (1) The volume of new scientific literature and data is immense, and integrating\nthis information into an LLM demands significant computational resources, storage, and time. (2) Frequent\nretraining or fine-tuning of large-scale models is both costly and technically challenging, often leading to\ndelays in knowledge integration that may render the model outdated in fast-moving research domains. (3)\nThe lack of efficient, fine-grained, and continuous learning mechanisms means that knowledge refreshing\nprocesses are typically slow, creating a persistent lag between the state of the art in scientific fields and the\nknowledge encoded in AI Scientist systems.\nCatastrophic Forgetting.Another fundamental challenge is catastrophic forgetting, which is the tendency of\nneural networks to lose previously acquired information when trained on new data (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017).\nFor an AI Scientist, this challenge means that attempts to update the model with new scientific knowledge\nmay inadvertently overwrite or degrade its understanding of existing scientific concepts, methods, and facts.\nSuch instability undermines the system’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and coherent body of scientific\nknowledge over time. As a result, integrating findings across different periods and scientific fields becomes\nparticularly challenging, which in turn impairs the LLM-based AI Scientist systems’ capacities to perform\nlongitudinal analyses, connect historical insights with emerging discoveries, and deliver consistent, reliable\nsupport for complex scientific explorations.\n7.2.2. Limitations of Research Capabilities of AI Scientist Systems\nThe research capabilities of current AI Scientist systems remain limited in several crucial aspects. These\nlimitations not only restrict their effectiveness in supporting and automating scientific research but also\nconstrain their potential to independently drive significant scientific breakthroughs. Below, we discuss core\ncapability gaps through the lens of the proposed capability framework (Figure 1).\nKnowledge acquisition.The ability to acquire, organize, and internalize knowledge from the vast and\nrapidly expanding body of scientific literature is the fundamental capability for an AI Scientist. This includes\nnot only searching for and retrieving relevant papers and results, but also extracting core ideas, incorporating\nexperimental details, and integrating disparate findings into a coherent understanding. However, existing AI\nScientist systems face several substantial challenges in this area, including:(1) Precision in information\nretrieval. The enormous scale and diversity of scientific literature make it difficult for current AI Scientist\nsystems to accurately retrieve the most relevant and up-to-date information for a given research prob-\nlem (Landhuis, 2016). They often struggle with the precise interpretation of complex or ambiguous queries,\neffective filtering of highly relevant documents, and ensuring that the results remain timely and reliable.

Despite notable advancements, the idea generation capability remains significantly con-\nstrained by several limitations:(1) Difficulty in generating high-quality hypotheses.Generating scientific\nhypotheses that are not only novel but also feasible is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of\nboth existing knowledge and the ability to identify innovative connections. However, empirical evidence sug-\ngests that current AI Scientist systems often fall short in this regard. Specifically, the ideas produced by these\nmodels tend to lack true originality and are frequently repetitive across different runs or even across different\nmodels (Lu et al., 2024). The underlying cause of this phenomenon is twofold: First, LLMs are fundamentally\nlimited by their training data, which constrains their ability to move beyond well-trodden conceptual ground.\nSecond, without advanced mechanisms for knowledge integration or creativity, AI Scientist systems tend to\nrely heavily on superficial text correlations, rather than generating ideas with genuine scientific novelty. This\nnot only leads to repetitive outputs but also limits the potential for breakthrough discoveries.(2) Challenges\nin evaluating the quality of AI-generated scientific hypotheses.A further limitation arises from the\nchallenge of reliably assessing the quality and potential impact of AI-generated scientific hypotheses. Unlike\nstandardized tasks with clear evaluation criteria, the value of a scientific hypothesis is often subjective,\ncontext-dependent, and difficult to quantify. Current evaluation methods rely heavily on human expert\njudgment, which is not only resource-intensive but also susceptible to subjectivity and inconsistency. Recent\nattempts to introduce automated evaluators have helped to some extent, but these systems themselves inherit\nthe biases and knowledge limitations of their underlying models. As a result, the lack of reliable, objective,\nand scalable evaluation frameworks for AI-generated hypotheses remains a bottleneck for the advancement\nof AI Scientist systems in real-world research settings.\nVerification and falsification.As discussed in Section 4, verification and falsification is a complex capability\nthat requires rigorous verification and potential falsification of hypotheses through experiment design, exe-\ncution, and validation. For AI Scientist systems, this process is both technically demanding and operationally\ncomplex, especially when considering the integration of multi-agent frameworks and collaboration with\nexternal tools or human researchers:(1) Multi-agent collaboration.In modern research environments,\neffective collaboration, whether with other AI agents, human scientists, or a variety of external tools, is\nessential for scientific progress (Guo et al., 2024, Qian et al., 2024, Pu et al., 2025). An AI Scientist should\nnot only understand collaborative protocols and division of labor but also reliably coordinate with diverse\nstakeholders, execute assigned tasks, and integrate outputs back into larger research workflows (Bo et al.,\n2024, Zhang et al., 2024c). Current AI Scientist systems, however, still exhibit significant weaknesses in\nrobustness, adaptability, and fault tolerance, particularly in dynamic or unpredictable environments (Wei\net al., 2025). For instance, they frequently encounter difficulties when interacting with changing external\nAPIs, handling error messages, or managing concurrent tasks, which are all crucial for real-world scientific"}

Consequently, the resulting experimental plans are frequently disconnected from the research\nfrontier and lack real-world applicability (Weng et al., 2025, Intology, 2025). Furthermore, as shown by the\nempirical evidence in Table 2, an AI Scientist encounters significant difficulties when translating conceptual\nunderstanding or initial plans into verifiably correct and executable code. For instance, on state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks such as SciReplicate-Bench (Xiang et al., 2025), the best execution accuracy achieved is only\n39%, which highlights a fundamental limitation in their execution and validation capabilities.\nEvolution. The ability of an AI Scientist to continuously evolve is essential for sustained scientific innovation.\nHowever, current AI Scientist systems demonstrate notable limitations in their evolutionary capabilities, which\nhinder their long-term progress and adaptability:(1) Dynamic planningrefers to the system’s ability to\nadaptively explore new research directions, update hypotheses, and iteratively refine experimental strategies.\nDespite its importance, this capability remains underdeveloped in existing AI Scientist systems. Recent\nstudies have introduced tree-search-based strategies. While these represent a meaningful step forward, they\nare still constrained by several factors: increased algorithmic complexity, substantial computational overhead,\nand limited scalability to large-scale scientific problems. As the number of possible research pathways grows,\ncurrent methods struggle to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation, often leading to diminishing\nreturns in both hypothesis quality and resource utilization.(2) Autonomous learning.A crucial component\nof evolution is the ability to learn from feedback, whether derived from internal self-reflection or from\nexternal sources. However, when relying solely on self-generated feedback through internal reflection, AI\nScientists are prone to “looping errors”, which means that mistakes can be amplified over multiple iterations,\nrather than corrected or improved. Without effective mechanisms for robust self-criticism, the system may\nfall into cycles of compounding errors, undermining both the originality and reliability of its research\noutput. While incorporating feedback from external sources (especially from other AI Scientist systems) holds\ngreat promise for collective intelligence, current frameworks lack standardized communication protocols\nfor scientist-to-scientist interactions. The absence of robust collaboration mechanisms results in inefficient\nexchange of ideas and suboptimal integration of external criticism, making AI Scientist systems unable to\nfully leverage the potential of agent collaboration, thus slowing down their evolution (Wang et al., 2025).\n7.3. Ethical Challenges\nThe emergence of AI Scientist systems has fundamentally reshaped the landscape of human research (King\net al., 2009). However, as autonomous research agents, AI Scientist systems are incapable of making ethical\njudgments about the societal impact of their work, and they do not self-regulate based on potential risks\nassociated with their findings (Bengio et al., 2025). In the absence of proper oversight, AI Scientist systems\nmay present a range of ethical challenges that require systematic consideration:\n(1) An AI Scientist may be misused, overwhelming the peer review system and leading to a decline in\noverall research quality.The rapid and large-scale generation of scientific artifacts by AI Scientist systems\ncan flood existing peer review mechanisms, making it difficult for human reviewers to rigorously assess the\nquality of submissions. This overload risks allowing low-quality, erroneous, or redundant work to enter the\nscientific record, thereby undermining the standards of academic publishing and slowing scientific progress."}

Such uncontrolled dissemination of knowledge\nmay accelerate the development and spread of potentially harmful scientific technologies, before adequate\nethical guidelines, safety protocols, or regulatory measures can be implemented (Huang et al., 2022).\n(3) An AI scientist may weaken the overall quality of scientific training and education, leading to\na decline in research standards and scientific literacy across all levels of human researchers.The\nwidespread use of AI Scientist systems throughout the research and education pipeline may encourage\nover-reliance on automated assistance for key tasks such as idea generation, experimental design, data\nanalysis, and hypothesis testing. Over time, this dependence could erode critical thinking, creativity, and\nhands-on research skills, ultimately diminishing scientific literacy and widening gaps between institutions\nwith differing levels of access to advanced AI tools (Yamada et al., 2025).\n(4) An AI scientist may introduce security vulnerabilities and research biases in the scientific re-\nsearch process.For instance, AI Scientist systems may utilize verification mechanisms unfaithful to their\nintended design, resulting in misleading results that are difficult to detect and require substantial human\noversight (Jansen et al., 2025). These issues not only waste valuable research resources but also diminish\nthe reliability of scientific findings. In addition, an AI Scientist tends to favor research topics with abundant\ndatasets or high potential for automation, which can incentivize funding organizations to prioritize such\nareas. This skews the equitable distribution of research funding and narrows the overall research land-\nscape (Yamada et al., 2025). Well-funded institutions are more capable of leveraging AI Scientist systems,\nfurther exacerbating existing inequalities and increasing entry barriers for early-career researchers.\nTo address these risks, there is an urgent need for acomprehensive system of generation management,\nethical oversight, and quality evaluationfor AI Scientist systems (Jobin et al., 2019). This management\nsystem should include, but not be limited to the following components:\n(1) A centralized platform to mitigate disruption to human review systems.This platform archives\nAI-generated scientific outputs and develops automated detection tools (e.g., DeepReview (Zhu et al., 2025))\nto identify and filter low-quality content. All AI-generated outputs must be clearly labeled with information\non their origin, generation methods, and involved scientific tools. Additionally, since authorship implies legal\nand ethical responsibilities that current AI systems cannot assume, AI Scientist systems must not be listed as\nofficial authors, and proper attribution of legal and ethical responsibilities must be ensured.\n(2) Clear boundaries between human-driven and AI-driven research activities to preserve essential\nhuman training and ensure well-rounded development for all researchers.Key stages of scientific\neducation and training (e.g., hypothesis formulation and experimental validation) should emphasize active\nhuman involvement to uphold high scientific standards. Educational institutions and research organizations\nshould develop clear guidelines to prevent excessive dependence on AI Scientist systems at all levels, from\nundergraduate students to experienced researchers, ensuring that AI serves as a tool rather than a human\nreplacement in the educational experience.\n(3) A global convention for ethical boundaries and risk management in AI-driven research, formulating\nglobal ethics and responsibility conventions.Full disclosure of generation processes, algorithmic sources,\nand potential risks should be mandatory (Huang et al., 2022).

Future Directions\nIn the previous sections, we reviewed the current achievements of AI Scientist systems (Section 2 - Section 6)\nand analyzed their limitations (Section 7) from two perspectives (deficiencies in foundation models and\ninadequacies in research capabilities), highlighting where we currently stand and what remains lacking.\nIn this section, we first outline potential directions to bridge the existing gaps in AI Scientist systems and\ndiscuss feasible pathways for their future development.\n8.1. Potential Directions to Bridge the Current Gap\nBy systematically addressing foundational limitations, managing long-term research endeavors comprehen-\nsively, and developing robust communication protocols, future AI Scientist systems can progressively bridge\nexisting gaps and realize their full potential as transformative agents in scientific discovery.\nAddressing fundamental model limitations and enhancing research abilities.As outlined in the previous\ndiscussion, a significant bottleneck for current AI Scientist systems lies in the intrinsic limitations of the\nfoundation models. Issues such as hallucinations, inefficiencies in knowledge updating, and catastrophic\nforgetting severely impede their reliability and scientific rigor. Addressing these fundamental constraints\nrequires substantial advancements in model architecture, training methodologies, and inference-time\nverification strategies.Potential solutions include developing hybrid model architectures that integrate\nsymbolic reasoning capabilities with deep learning architectures to enhance interpretability and factual\naccuracy. Additionally, methods such as RAG and continual learning frameworks could mitigate issues\nrelated to data recency and model adaptability, ensuring that AI Scientists maintain up-to-date and verifiable\nscientific knowledge. Moreover, it is also crucial toadvance AI Scientist systems’ research capabilities(e.g.,\nhypothesis assessment, and scientific reasoning) through evolutionary mechanisms. Enhancements could\ninclude incorporating iterative preference training and structured self-reflection mechanisms, allowing\nmodels to autonomously refine their capabilities based on rigorous internal critiques and external feedback.\nManaging long-term research cycles.A mature AI Scientist should autonomously manage comprehensive,\nlong-term research cycles. Current AI Scientist systems, however, predominantly focus on short-term\nindividual research tasks. Future AI Scientist systems must incorporate sophisticated dynamic planning\nmethods, such ashierarchical planning frameworksor agentic tree-search algorithms, to effectively\nnavigate extensive research pathways. Additionally, to further facilitate iterative improvement loops, AI\nScientist systems could incorporate frameworks likegenetic algorithm-based refinementor reinforcement\nlearning-driven optimization.These mechanisms can help prioritize research objectives, efficiently allocate\nresources, and adaptively refine strategies based on progressive insights, thus significantly improving the\ndepth and breadth of autonomous scientific discoveries.\nDeveloping communication protocols for AI Scientist systems.Another critical future direction involves\ndeveloping standardized Scientist-to-Scientist Communication Protocols (SSCP), enabling structured and\nefficient interactions among AI Scientist systems. Current efforts in AI-driven research collaborations\nprimarily rely on ad hoc communication methods, thus lacking standardized interaction workflows and\nunified communication formats. Establishing an SSCP could profoundly enhance AI Scientists’ collaborative\ncapabilities, promoting effective information exchange, hypothesis validation, and multi-agent research\ncoordination. Such a communication protocol should specify interaction workflows, structured data formats,"}

Leveraging these standardized communication protocols could further advance the formation of\nAI-driven research communities, enabling collective intelligence to tackle complex interdisciplinary research\nchallenges with unprecedented effectiveness and rigor.\n8.2. The Pathway of AI Scientist\nUnlike human scientists,AI Scientist systems evolve through a self-organizing progressionthat could\nbe more distinct and efficient than human approaches. While human scientists accumulate knowledge\nthrough periods of formal education, hands-on experiments, and ethical training, AI Scientist systems\nprogress by integrating specialized modules, such as LLMs, simulation engines, and robotic systems. This\nmodular approach positions the development of AI Scientists closer to system engineering, facilitating\nrapid enhancements in research capabilities and enabling significant efficiency gains in scientific endeavors.\nFurthermore, forcing AI Scientists to replicate human developmental paths might constrain their\npotential. AI systems excel in rapidly processing and analyzing extensive datasets, enabling them to identify\nresearch problems and formulate solutions within significantly shorter timescales. Hence, development\nefforts for AI Scientist systems should prioritize leveraging their intrinsic strengths (e.g., cross-disciplinary\nknowledge integration), rather than replicating the pathways of human scientists.\nAt this early stage of development, the future pathways of an AI Scientist can be envisioned alongtwo inter-\ndependent paradigms: (1) Personalized AI Scientist systemstailored to individual human researchers,\nempowering them through personalized, co-evolutionary partnerships, and(2) AI Scientist systems serving\nbroader human society, accelerating global solutions. The former aims to enhance the research productivity\nand creative capacities of individual scientists through tailored collaborations. In contrast, the latter seeks to\nestablish AI-driven scientific ecosystems, effectively addressing complex global challenges. Together, these\npathways converge toward a vision where AI Scientist systems transcend tool-like functionality to become\nproactive stewards of scientific advancement, balancing autonomy with human oversight to uphold integrity,\ninclusivity, and societal benefit (Tsvetkova et al., 2024).\n8.2.1. AI Scientist for Individual Researcher\nActive Learning. A personalized AI Scientist should actively gain experiences, analyze mistakes, and\nabsorb the latest knowledge tailored for individual human researchers. This includes: (1) Knowledge gap\nidentification: Identifying gaps in a researcher’s knowledge by reviewing their publications, notes, and\nunresolved questions. (2) Personalized literature curation: Recommending papers based on the researcher’s\nspecificresearchinterests, currentprojectstage, andexperimentalbottlenecks(Heetal.,2025). (3)Real-time\nlearning: Real-timesummarizationofemergingliterature(Agarwaletal.,2024a)coupledwithcontextualized\nexplanations of unfamiliar concepts.\nPreference alignment of human researchers.Effective alignment involves matching the capabilities of\nAI Scientist systems with human research goals, including but not limited to: (1) Value-driven hypothesis\ngeneration: aligning hypothesis proposals with the researcher’s research preferences, risk tolerance and\nresource constraints.

ApersonalizedAIScientistprogressestogetherwithhumanresearchers\nthrough continuous scientific research activity: (1) Bidirectional refinement loops: AI Scientist systems and\nresearchers iteratively refine scientific artifacts through mutual feedback (Romera-Paredes et al., 2024).\n(2) Evolutionary personalization: Continuous preference tuning via reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (Ouyang et al., 2022), where AI Scientist systems adapt to a researcher’s evolving style, balancing\nautonomy (e.g., automated verification) with human oversight.\n8.2.2. AI Scientist for Human Society\nAdapt to the trend of scientific development.An AI Scientist serving broader human society must\ndynamicallyadapttotheacceleratingpaceandinterdisciplinarynatureofmodernresearchby: (1)Continuous\nknowledge integration: Efficiently integrating emerging research from diverse fields (e.g., bioinformatics,\nquantum computing) while preventing loss of previous knowledge (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017). (2) Cross-\ndomain collaboration: Enable interdisciplinary discovery by transferring methods across fields (e.g., applying\nML-driven drug discovery to materials science). (3) Predictive research: Identifying emerging scientific\ntrends using network analysis of preprint repositories (e.g., arXiv, bioRxiv) and funding trends, guiding\nresearch focus toward critical topics like climate resilience or pandemic preparedness.\nProspects for human development. AI Scientist systems can greatly boost human progress by: (1)\nReducing resource gaps by providing open-access tools and cloud-based experimental simulators, enabling\nunder-resourced institutions to participate in global research. (2) Accelerating discovery for critical challenges\n(e.g., renewable energy, disease treatment) through automated experimentation. Early successes like Chem-\nCrow (Bran et al., 2023) and BioDiscoveryAgent (Roohani et al., 2024) show promise in chemistry/biology.\nAs these systems increasingly interface with physical laboratories (e.g., IoT sensors), they may evolve to\nsupport full-cycle scientific workflows.\n9. Conclusion\nThis paper presented a systematic survey of existing research on AI Scientist systems, providing a com-\nprehensive overview of advances in the field. Specifically, we proposed a capability-level framework that\ndivides the capabilities of an AI Scientist into four progressive levels: knowledge acquisition, idea generation,\nverification and falsification, and evolution. Based on this framework, we critically analyzed current research\nand highlighted gaps AI Scientist systems must address before they can make ground-breaking discoveries\nthat solve grand challenges across medicine, energy, and the environment, thereby changing the world and\nreshaping the scientific research paradigm. Finally, we concluded the survey by outlining future directions\nessential for closing the gap and advancing the field toward truly autonomous scientific intelligence.\n27"}

In verifiable reasoning, our synthetic data significantly\noutperforms existing training datasets, such as s1k and OpenMathReasoning,\nacross MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For non-verifiable\ninstruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the performance of human or\nstandard self-instruct prompts on both AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe transformative rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has initiated a substantial paradigm\nshift in the domain of deep learning (Zhang et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023; Long et al., 2024). The\ndevelopment of such models emphasizes scale, and relies heavily on large volumes of high-quality\ndata (Gandhi et al., 2024; Abdin et al., 2024). However, acquiring such data from human sources can\noften be challenging or even impractical due to factors such as high costs, data scarcity, and privacy\nconcerns (Kurakin et al., 2023). Furthermore, several studies (Hosking et al., 2023; Singh et al.,\n2023; Gilardi et al., 2023) have pointed out that human-generated data, being inherently prone to\nbiases and errors, may not always be ideal for model training or evaluation. In this context, synthetic\ndata emerges as a viable alternative for obtaining high-quality datasets.\nSynthetic data is artificially generated to replicate the characteristics and patterns of real-world data.\nOne innovative approach to creating such data is the Self-Instruct method (Wang et al., 2022a),\nwhich utilizes LLMs themselves to generate instruction-following examples. This method begins\nby selecting a small set of seed instruction-following samples, which are then used to prompt LLMs\nto produce additional demonstrations in a similar format. Since then a number of variants have been\nintroduced that increase the complexity of queries (Liu et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2024), maintain\nsemantic diversity (Ding et al., 2023), scale the synthetic data (Yuan et al., 2023), and use these\nmethods in self-improvement loops (Yuan et al., 2024). However, a significant challenge with these\napproaches is to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the generated data for language model train-\ning. Overall, generating high-quality synthetic data and optimizing its use for both reasoning and\nnon-reasoning tasks still remains insufficiently understood.\nIn this paper, we present Chain-of-Thought(CoT)-Self-Instruct, a method that both (i) uses reason-\ning to help create high quality synthetic data; and (ii) self-filters the created data to only keep the\nhighest quality ones, see Figure 1. We show the efficacy of this approach for creating both verifiable\nreasoning data and non-verifiable instruction following tasks, where in both cases using Chain-of-\nThought (CoT) to help generate the examplesoutperforms those generated without CoT. To curate\nhigh quality verifiable data we introduce Answer-Consistency, which discards examples where the\nCoT-Self-Instruct-generated answer does not match the majority vote solution of the LLM, with the\nassumption that those examples are either incorrectly labeled or too difficult. For non-verifiable data\nwe use the recent Rejecting Instruction Preferences (RIP) (Yu et al., 2025) method which measures\nthe quality of prompts based on the distribution of reward model scores from LLM solutions.

The success of RLHF for post-training (Stiennon et al., 2020; Rafailov et al.,\n2024) has attracted more attention to collecting large scale and high quality preference data. Most\nwork involving preference optimization employs existing methods derived from pretraining and\ninstruction-tuning (Touvron et al., 2023; Muennighoff et al., 2025), such as deduplication, clustering,\nquality classifiers or filtering heuristics. Rejecting Instruction Preferences (RIP) (Yu et al., 2025) is\na recent method that gives strong performance by leveraging reward models based on the LLM\nresponses to filter prompts. For verifiable reasoning tasks, Self-Consistency filtering (Prasad et al.,\n2024) has also been shown to be a high quality curation method by rejecting prompts where LLM\nsolutions show no agreement, as the task is either incorrectly labeled or too difficult.\n3 C HAIN -OF-THOUGHT (COT)-S ELF -INSTRUCT\n(CoT)-Self-Instruct is an approach to generate high quality synthetic data for training using rea-\nsoning. We first assume access to a language model, and a small amount of high quality human-\nannotated seed data. We consider both verifiable reasoning domains, and non-verifiable general\ninstruction following. Our approach involves two stages:\n1. Synthetic Instruction Creation with Chain-of-Thought (CoT): given sample human-\nannotated seed instructions, we instruct the LLM to reason step by step to come up with\ninstructions of similar complexity and domain.\n2. Synthetic Instruction Curation: we curate the generated synthetic data to keep only high-\nquality instructions for self-training.\nWe then train LLMs using the generated high quality synthetic instructions. We describe each stage\nin turn.\n3.1 S YNTHETIC INSTRUCTION CREATION VIA COT\nThe process of CoT-Self-Instruct data creation starts with a small set of seed instructions as the\ninstruction pool. Multiple instructions are sampled at random from the instruction pool, and then\nused to few-shot prompt a language model to generate a series of intermediate reasoning steps,\nfollowed by a new instruction. Unlike standard Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2022a) which directly\nprompts the model to write new instructions given a list of seed instructions, each time we show the\nLLM an N-shot set of sample instructions, we first ask it to carefully analyze the given instructions,\nsuch as domain, complexity and purpose. After analyzing the seed instructions, reflecting on what\nmakes them high quality prompts, the LLM is prompted to reason step by step to come up with a plan\nto generate a new self-contained instruction that is of similar quality and complexity as the given seed\ninstructions, and ultimately to output the final synthetic instruction satisfying these requirements in\na strict answer format.\nVerifiable reasoning tasks For reasoning tasks where there is a deterministic answer which we\ncan compare against to generate verifiable rewards during training, we instruct the LLM to use\nreasoning to generate both an instruction and the verifiable target. The prompt we used for CoT-\nSelf-Instruct on reasoning tasks is given in Figure 2.\nGeneral instruction following tasks For tasks involving general instruction-following with open-\nended responses, we direct the LLM to use reasoning to generate only the instruction, not the re-\nsponse itself.

Given the task instruction, we first instruct the LLM to generate K responses and take the\nmajority response. We then reject the data example and remove it from the training pool if the\nmajority response does not match the target answer in the synthetic data example generated by CoT-\nSelf-Instruct (i.e., via Figure 2). Because the target answer from CoT-Self-Instruct is generated\nwith extensive reasoning steps during instruction writing and question-answering (Figure 2) this\ndiffers from the way a response is generated at inference time and might be more accurate. Hence,\ncomparing if the two labels match gives an extra layer of filtering. We confirm in our experiments\nthat Answer-Consistency is superior to standard Self-Consistency filtering (Prasad et al., 2024).\nGeneral instruction following tasks For non-verifiable tasks, the Answer-Consistency method is\nnot applicable. Instead, we employ the Rejecting Instruction Preferences (RIP) method as proposed\nby Yu et al. (2025). In this method, for a given task instruction, K responses are generated, and\neach response is evaluated using a reward model (RM), resulting in a score for each response. The\nfiltering process is then based on the distribution of these scores. In our setting we use the lowest\nscore among these K responses to represent the score of the synthetic prompt. We then filter the data\nby selecting only those prompts with the higher scores. Notably, this approach can also be applied\nto verifiable tasks, and we conduct experiments in that context as well.\n3.3 S ELF -TRAINING WITH SYNTHETIC DATA\nAfter generating the synthetic training data, we can conduct RL training on the set of generated\ninstructions. We compare the performance of self-trained LLMs with models trained on human-\nannotated data and on seed instructions in reasoning and non-reasoning domains respectively. For\nverifiable reasoning tasks, we use GRPO (Shao et al., 2024), and for general instruction following\nwe consider both offline DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024) and online DPO, which can perform much\nbetter, see e.g. Lanchantin et al. (2025).\n4 E XPERIMENTAL SETUP\nWe study the effectiveness of our synthetic prompt generation approach for reasoning and non-\nreasoning domains along the following two axes: synthetic prompt generation, and prompt curation.\n4.1 R EASONING\nSeed Instructions We use s1k (Muennighoff et al., 2025) reasoning instructions as our seed rea-\nsoning tasks. The s1k dataset consists of 1000 high-quality, diverse and difficult reasoning prompts.\nTo conduct self-training with verifiable rewards we select a subset of s1k consisting of 893 verifi-\nable reasoning instructions by filtering out theorem-proving questions and only keeping those that\nyield a scalar, single-valued, or simple closed-form answers that can be easily verified (such as1, A,\nF alse, 2(n−1)(n−2)\nn(n+1) ). We then use this subset as the seed instruction pool to generate more verifiable\nreasoning instructions.\nPrompt Generation The CoT-Self-Instruct template is given in Figure 2, and the baseline Self-\nInstruct method is given in Appendix Figure 6. To evaluate how CoT-Self-Instruct compares to base-\nlines for generating verifiable reasoning tasks, we apply these methods to Qwen3-4B-Base models,\nQwen3-4B model with Think mode and Qwen3-4B model with NoThink mode (Yang et al., 2025).\nWe use temperature = 0.7 and top-p=0.8 for Qwen3-4B-Base and Qwen3-4B (NoThink mode), and\ntemperature = 0.6 and top-p=0.95 for Qwen3-4B (Think mode).\nRLVR Training All our reasoning experiments use GRPO training initialized from Qwen3-4B-\nBase with reinforcement learning from rule-based verifiable rewards (RLVR). For hyperparameters,\nwe use a cosine learning rate scheduler with a peak value of1e −6 and adopt the AdamW optimizer\nfor the policy model.

All GRPO experiments are conducted with VeRL(Sheng et al.,\n2024) and Math-Verify 1 as verifier.\nBaselines & Variations We construct targets for Self-Instruct and CoT-Self-Instruct when build-\ning the generated instructions. As a baseline, we also train on the original s1k prompts rather than\nsynthetic data, in that case we use the public available DeepSeek R1 (Guo et al., 2025) thinking\nsolution from simplescaling/s1K-1.1 to build targets. We also compare to training on OpenMath-\nReasoning which consists of 10k prompts (Moshkov et al., 2025) with publicly available solutions\nby DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B. We also explore some alternative ways of filtering data or con-\nstructing targets, explored as variations on our main experiments:\n• Self-Consistency filtering: generating responses K times with random seeds and then se-\nlecting the majority-voted answer as the target or rejecting the example if the majority\nanswer receives fewer votes than a given threshold (50% in our main experiments).\n• RIP filtering: we use the infly/INF-ORM-Llama3.1-70B (Minghao Yang, 2024) RM.\n• Best-of-K targets: constructing targets by selecting the highest scored answer out of K\nresponses using INF-ORM-Llama3.1-70B RM.\nEvaluation We evaluate using Math500 (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Lightman et al., 2023), AIME\n2024, AMC 23, and GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2024). We use temperature 0.6 and top-p 0.95 to\ngenerate predictions. For each problem we generate N = 16 solutions and report average accuracy.\n4.2 N ON-VERIFIABLE INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING\nSeed Instructions We use the Wildchat-RIP-Filtered-by-8b-Llama dataset 2 which includes 4k\nhigh-quality prompts filtered from 20k raw wildchat prompts as our seed prompts. Unlike in some\nreasoning tasks, this data includes a variety of different domains. Combining, for instance, prompts\nfrom storytelling and coding as few-shot examples could result in generating unnatural synthetic\nprompts. To address this, we categorized all seed data into 8 distinct categories. During sampling,\nwe select 2 seed prompts from the same category to serve as few-shot prompts. Our seed data spans\n8 categories: Writing & Storytelling, Technical & Programming, Creative & Design, Data & Analy-\nsis, Education & Research, Communication & Support, Business & Marketing, and Miscellaneous.\nPrompt Generation We evaluate how CoT-Self-Instruct compares to baselines for generating\nnon-verifiable instruction-following tasks by applying these methods using LLama 3.1-8B-Instruct.\nThe CoT-Self-Instruct template is given in Figure 3, and the baseline Self-Instruct method is given\nin Figure 4. We also experiment with a prompt that lies between the two methods by generating a\nshort rather than long CoT, given in Figure 5. For RIP filtering, we use the Athene-RM-8B model 3\nreward model over 32 responses.\nDPO Training We train via DPO starting from LLama 3.1-8B-Instruct, leveraging thefairseq2\nlibrary (Balioglu, 2023). We use a batch size of64 and learning rate of1e−6 with dropout rate of 0.0\nand a β value of 0.1 throughout the experiments. For each prompt, we generate 64 responses. These\nresponses are then annotated with Athene-RM-8B to select pairs. Compared to human prompts, our\nsynthetic prompts tend to be more complex, resulting in longer average response lengths, which can\nlead to length explosion. During DPO training, the evaluation judge often favors longer responses,\npotentially causing response lengths to increase over time (Yuan et al., 2024). To mitigate this\nissue, we adopted the approach outlined by Wu et al. (2024), which involves combining the reward\nscore with length information to determine the preferred response. This method ensures that shorter\nresponses are selected when scores are similar. We applied a length normalization coefficient of 0.2\nfor the length-normalized reward. This is applied for all methods, in each case sampling 5k DPO\npairs.\n1https://github.com/huggingface/Math-Verify"}

These are robust instruction-\nfollowing benchmarks that show a strong correlation with user preferences.

As shown in Appendix Table 8 similar trends are observed when\ntraining on Qwen3-4B-base, rather than Qwen3-4B, generated targets.\nFiltered CoT-Self-Instruct outperforms filtered Self-Instruct Applying filtering methods to\nboth CoT-Self-Instruct and Self-Instruct improves both methods, despite the overall amount of train-\ning data decreasing, see Table 1.

E.g. with Self-Consistency Filtering Self-Instruct\nimproves from 49.5% → 53.6%, while CoT-Self-Instruct improves from 53.0% → 55.1%. Similar\nfindings are observed with RIP filtering as well.

In this\nparadigm, LLMs act as evaluators, with one common ap-\nplication being pairwise comparisons where the model de-\ncides which of two text segments is better based on criteria\nlike quality, relevance, or coherence. However, the practi-\ncal value of these systems depends not only on accuracy but\nalso on trustworthy, risk-aware judgments that can adapt to\nreal-world deployment scenarios.

This misalignment\nresults in substantial risks: overconfident models may propa-\ngate erroneous judgments without detection, eroding the ef-\nficiency gains of automated evaluation, while also compli-\ncating downstream decision-making in pipelines (Gu et al.\n2024). Furthermore, existing benchmarks and metrics ex-\nacerbate the problem by focusing on aggregate accuracy\nwithout addressing confidence alignment, introducing biases\nsuch as response length or model familiarity that distort cal-\nibration assessments (Chen et al. 2024; Zheng et al. 2023;\nWang et al. 2023a). Consequently, the lack of calibration-\naware tools limits the deployment of LLMs as dependable\nevaluators in high-stakes environments.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce TH-Score, a\nnovel metric that quantifies confidence-accuracy alignment\nby focusing on critical high- and low-confidence intervals,\nwhere practical decisions hinge. Unlike traditional metrics\nlike accuracy or Expected Calibration Error (ECE)—which\nignore confidence or overlook key thresholds—TH-Score\nbalances accuracy within these intervals against their cov-\nerage, rewarding aligned successes (e.g., high-confidence\ncorrect predictions) while penalizing mismatches like over-\nconfident errors. This makes TH-Score a principled tool for\ndetecting the Overconfidence Phenomenon under LLM-as-\na-Judge scenario, highlighting cases where high confidence\nfails to match actual correctness.\nFurthermore, we propose LLM-as-a-Fuser, an ensemble\nframework that leverages a dedicated ”fuser” LLM to syn-\nthesize judgments and critiques from multiple models, trans-\nforming LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators. By inte-\ngrating diverse perspectives, LLM-as-a-Fuser significantly\nenhances calibration. Extensive experiments on a widely-\nused benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves su-\nperior calibration, reliability, and overall accuracy compared\nto existing baselines, paving the way for more trustworthy\nLLM-as-a-Judge systems in practical settings.\nIn a nutshell, our contributions are threefold:\n• Overconfidence Phenomenon: We systematically iden-\ntify and characterize the overconfidence in LLM-as-a-\nJudge, where confidence overstates correctness, limiting\nrisk-aware evaluation.\n• Metric Innovation : We introduce TH-Score, a novel\nmetric quantifying confidence-accuracy alignment for\ntrustworthy LLM judgments.\n• Framework Advancement : We propose LLM-as-a-\nFuser, an ensemble approach that enhances calibration,\nenabling adaptive, confidence-driven pipelines with su-\nperior reliability and accuracy.\n2 Related Work\nLLM-as-a-Judge\nLLMs are increasingly used as automated evaluators for\ntext quality. (Zheng et al. 2023) showed GPT-4 aligns with\nhuman judgments in pairwise comparisons, but proprietary\nAPIs limit reproducibility. PandaLM (Wang et al. 2023b)\nintroduced a 7B-parameter local evaluator with 94% agree-\nment with ChatGPT, supporting offline use. JudgeLM (Zhu,\nWang, and Wang 2025) and Agent-as-a-Judge (Zhuge et al.\n2024) use modular frameworks with memory and planning,\ncutting DevAI evaluation costs by 97%. However, alignment\nbetween model confidence and accuracy is often ignored,\ncausing inconsistent judgments. Meta’s self-rewarding mod-\nels (Wu et al. 2024) generate and evaluate outputs iteratively,\nbut calibration needs further study.\nAs LLM-based judges gain traction for evaluating and en-\nhancing LLMs, various benchmarks have emerged to gauge\ntheir effectiveness. Prior works like LLMEval (Lin and\nChen 2023), MTBench, and FairEval primarily assess how\nwell LLM-based judges align with subjective human pref-\nerences, often emphasizing stylistic differences over factual\nand logical accuracy.

Tradi-\ntional methods like temperature scaling (Guo et al. 2017)\nadjust confidence with a single scalar but are less effec-\ntive for large models, while Bayesian methods are compu-\ntationally infeasible.

However, most techniques focus on single mod-\nels, missing multi-model aggregation benefits, and Collab-\norative Calibration (Yang et al. 2024) reduces overconfi-\ndence via multi-agent deliberation but requires significant\nresources. Current research lacks focus on calibration’s im-\npact on downstream tasks like data generation, where confi-\ndence filtering affects output quality, warranting further ex-\nploration.\nUncertainty Quantification and Reward Modeling\nUncertainty-aware frameworks bridge calibration and prac-\ntical applications. Generating with Confidence (Lin, Trivedi,\nand Sun 2023) combines Monte Carlo dropout and response\nlength analysis to filter low-confidence outputs, demonstrat-\ning that well-calibrated models yield higher-quality syn-\nthetic data. Inference-Time Scaling (Liu et al. 2025) dy-\nnamically aligns reward models with human preferences,\nindirectly improving calibration through gradient-free op-\ntimization. However, these approaches often assume static\ndatasets, failing to address the iterative nature of LLM-as-\na-Judge workflows. Benchmarking LLMs via Uncertainty\nQuantification (Ye et al. 2024) reveals that calibration de-\ngrades under distribution shifts (e.g., domain-specific tasks),\nunderscoring the need for adaptive methods."}

Underconfident models tend to underesti-\nmate their own accuracy, while overconfident ones over-\nestimate their judgment correctness. Such biases introduce\nnoisy signals that can adversely affect the performance of\ndownstream tasks (e.g., reward modeling). Particularly in\nunsupervised or weakly-supervised scenarios, developing\na well-calibrated model where judgment capability aligns\nwith confidence becomes crucial. By acquiring confidence\nof model judgments, we can not only filter out low-accuracy\npredictions but also effectively identify high-accuracy deci-\nsions, thereby enhancing the overall system reliability.\nHow to measure confidence in LLMs?\nWe employed three methods for calculating confidence:\nSelf-Confidence (SC), Multiple-Prompting (MP) confi-\ndence, and Logprob confidence.\nSC setting: We prompt the model to output both the result\nand its confidence. Model’s temperature is set to 0 to ensure\nthe reproducibility of the setting.\nMP setting: We adopt a method similar to SimpleQA (Wei\net al. 2024), but reduce the number of requests from 100\nto 10 for efficiency, while keeping the temperature at 0.7.\nThe final reply is determined by majority voting, and the\nconfidence is the count of the chosen response over 10.\nLogP Setting. In this setting, confidence scores are derived\nfrom softmax-normalized logits for the final output tokens\n(e.g., ‘A’ or ‘B’). For a binary choice task with options A\nand B, and corresponding logits lA and lB, we first compute\nthe softmax probabilities:\np(A) = elA\nelA + elB\n, p (B) = elB\nelA + elB\n.\nConfidence is then defined as the maximum probability:\nConfidencelogp = max (p(A), p(B)) .\nTemperature is set to 0 to ensure deterministic outputs.\nExisting Calibration Evaluation Metrics\nTo conduct an objective and comprehensive evaluation of\nthe calibration of LLM-as-a-Judge, we applied five existing\nmetrics—Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Adaptive Cal-\nibration Error (ACE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE),\nBrier Score, and Negative Log Likelihood (NLL)—to the\nthree confidence calculation methods described earlier in\nthis section. Table 2 provides a brief introduction to the cal-\nculation methods and characteristics of these metrics.\nInitial Results\nWe systematically evaluate 14 cutting-edge models on\nthe JudgeBench benchmark, with complete results pre-\nsented in Table1. These include open-source models such\nas Qwen3-235B-A22B (Qwen Team 2025), DeepSeek-\nR1-0528 (DeepSeek-AI et al. 2025), R1-Distill-Qwen,\nR1-Distill-Llama, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (DeepSeek-AI et al.\n2024), Llama-3.3-70B (Dubey et al. 2024), and Mistral-\nNemo (Team 2024), as well as proprietary models like\nOpenAI-o3-mini (OpenAI 2025b), Claude-Sonnet-4 (An-\nthropic 2025), GPT-4.1 (OpenAI 2025a), GPT-4.1-mini,\nGemini-2.5-Flash (DeepMind 2025), GPT-4o (Ahmad et al.\n2024), and GPT-4.1-nano, with special attention to scaled\nvariants (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini/nano and o3-mini).

The table also includes accuracy\nrates within specified intervals and the proportion of interval\ndata relative to the total dataset. When ϵ = 0.05, most mod-\nels, except the most powerful ones, exhibit limited calibra-\ntion capability. Consequently, most models either have min-\nimal data within this interval or demonstrate significantly\nreduced accuracy, highlighting the stringent calibration de-\nmands of such a small ϵ and underscoring the challenges\nin achieving reliable confidence alignment at fine-grained\nthresholds. At ϵ = 0.1, the value used in our primary exper-\niments, most models align well with this calibration thresh-\nold, resulting in strong discriminative power. With the ex-\nception of weaker models like Mistral-Nemo, the majority\nof models have substantial data within this interval, enabling\neffective comparison of their calibration performance. This\nobservation suggests that an effective approach for selecting\nϵ is to choose a value where most models contribute signifi-\ncant data to the interval.\nHowever, when ϵ is increased to 0.15, while data cover-\nage improves,the discriminative power diminishes. The ad-\nvantages of high-performing models, such as DeepSeek-R1-\n0528, become less pronounced due to the relaxed perfor-\nmance requirements associated with a larger ϵ. Thus, select-\ning an appropriate ϵ requires balancing data coverage with\ndiscriminative power, avoiding excessively large values that\ndilute model differentiation.\n5 LLM-as-a-Fuser\nAs shown in the section on overconfidence in LLM-as-a-\njudge, while LLM-as-a-judge offers a promising approach\nto evaluating model outputs, its calibration issues—such\nas overconfidence in unreliable judgments—limit its relia-\nbility. Traditional aggregation methods (e.g., majority vot-\ning) compound this problem by ignoring nuanced critiques\nfrom individual models and focusing only on final decisions.\nTo address these limitations, we propose LLM-as-a-Fuser\nframework, which redefines the LLM’s role from a passive\njudge to an active fuser. By synthesizing model decisions\nand their rationales, the fuser enables evidence-aware aggre-\ngation, improving both calibration and robustness.\nMethodology\nThe fuser LLM ingests decisions and critiques from an en-\nsemble of models, analyzing their reasoning. Unlike tradi-\ntional methods, this approach grounds the final decision in\ncomprehensive evidence, as illustrated in Figure 4.\nBaseline Methods\nTo evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Fuser, we com-\npare it against several baseline aggregation methods that\ncombine predictions from multiple models.

LLM-as-a-Fuser with Qwen3-235B-A22B achieves\nthe highest accuracy (86.29%) and best calibration (ECE\nof 6.42%), outperforming baselines like Entropy Weighted\nV oting (81.71% Acc, 8.48% ECE) and showing substan-\ntial gains over SC models (e.g., +8.86% Acc and -5.36%\nECE relative to its SC counterpart at 77.43% Acc, 11.78%\nECE). Notably, models like Mistral-Nemo exhibit the most\ndramatic improvements (+47.14% Acc, -53.73% ECE), fol-\nlowed by Gemini-2.5-Flash (+38.57% Acc) and GPT-4.1-\nnano (+30.85% Acc), indicating that weaker SC perform-\ners benefit significantly from critique integration in the fuser\nframework. Baseline aggregation methods also surpass in-\ndividual SC performances; for instance, Entropy Weighted\nV oting exceeds the top SC model by ∼4.28% in accuracy\nand 3.3% in ECE, while other baselines ( ∼80% Acc) out-\nperform most SC models. Other fusers vary, with GPT-4o\nthe weakest (49.71% Acc, 44.07% ECE). Critique integra-\ntion drives LLM-as-a-Fuser’s superior accuracy and calibra-\ntion, and ensemble methods generally yield better results\nthan isolated self-confidence evaluations."}

Such an emerging\ntrend has sparked widespread interest within the research community in the direction of \"RL for LLM\" (or\nRL4LLM). In 2025, RL4LLM experienced a surge in research activity, leading to hundreds of publications\nacross arXiv and major conferences, covering a wide range of topics from algorithmic innovation to\npractical engineering solutions.\nHowever, this rapid progress is shadowed by the lack of usage guidelines for existing RL techniques or\ntricks (Huang et al., 2024a) as well as the absence of in-depth analysis of their underlying mechanisms.\nSpecifically, these limitations can manifest as confusion among practitioners in choosing RL tricks, as\ndifferent papers provide different solutions to the same problem. For instance, GRPO (Shao et al.,\n2024) advocates for group-level normalization to enhance policy stability, whereas REINFORCE++\n(Hu et al., 2025) argues that batch-level normalization works better. Moreover, GRPO incorporates\nvariance in normalization, yet Dr. GRPO (Liu et al., 2025a) explicitly recommends removing variance\nnormalization to prevent bias. Another example: GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) has achieved a breakthrough\nin performance through the strategy of using response-level loss calculation, while DAPO (Yu et al., 2025)\nhas instead adopted token-level loss calculation. Such contradictory and chaotic phenomena underscore\nthe fragmented understanding and inconsistent recommendations within the RL4LLM community.\nOne possible reason for the above phenomenon is that the experimental settings, training data, and\ninitialization of the existing work all have significant differences, which may also cause deviations in the\nsummary of the conclusions.\nApart from the confusion caused by the intrinsic differences of similar techniques, the numerous and\nseemingly orthogonal techniques, including Normalization, Clip, and Overlong Filtering, also increase the\ncomplexity of algorithm application in practice. Practitioners face non-trivial challenges in selecting an\nappropriate combination from a wide range of techniques to unlock the learning capacity of LLMs in\nspecific scenarios. These ambiguities have naturally triggered a key requirement of practitioners:\nWhat scenarios are the existing techniques respectively suitable for? Is there a simple and generalized\ncombination that can be used to enhance policy optimization?\nAligned with classic RL mechanism analysis methodologies (Andrychowicz et al., 2020; Engstrom et al.,\n2020; Huang et al., 2024a), we systematically review the widely used RL techniques by reproducing\nthem and independently evaluating the actual impact of each technique, based on the same open-source\ninfrastructure framework and policy models. To comprehensively cover practical scenarios, we design\nextensive experimental settings incorporating datasets of varying difficulty levels, diverse model sizes,\nand distinct model types. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of their theoretical foundations,\nimplementation details, and applicable scenarios as demons. The intuitive contribution is illustrated in\nFigure 1.

It improves the stability of policy learning by optimizing a\nclipped surrogate objective that restricts the divergence between the new and old policies during training.\nThe PPO objective is:\nJPPO(θ) =Eh\nq∼P(Q), o∼πθold (O|q)\ni\n1\n|o|\n|o|\n∑\nt=1\nmin\n \nπθ(ot|q, o<t)\nπθold (ot|q, o<t) At, clip\n\u0012 πθ(ot|q, o<t)\nπθold (ot|q, o<t), 1−ϵ, 1+ϵ\n\u0013\nAt\n!\n,\n(1)\nwhere πθ and πθold denote the current and old policy models, respectively. q and o represent the sampled\nquestion and output sequence, with ot as the t-th token in o. ϵ is a clipping hyperparameter for stabilizing\nupdates. At is the advantage at step t, typically estimated via Generalized Advantage Estimation\n(GAE) (Schulman et al., 2018). The objective encourages the new policy to improve advantage-weighted\nprobabilities while constraining changes within a trust region.\n2.2 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), proposed in DeepSeekMath (Shao et al., 2024), eliminates\nthe value function (critic) and instead estimates the advantage by normalizing rewards within a group of\nsampled responses for the same prompt. Specifically, for a prompt x with G responses and associated\nrewards {ri}G\ni=1, the group-normalized advantage is given by:\nˆAi,t = ri − mean({ri}G\ni=1)\nstd({ri}G\ni=1) . (2)\nThe effectiveness of the above normalization method can be understood from the perspective of reward\nshaping. By emphasizing the differences among candidate outputs for the same prompt, it effectively\npreserves the reliability of the gradient signal, even in sparse reward settings (Hu et al., 2020). Instead\nof adding KL penalty in the reward, GRPO directly regularizes by directly adding the KL divergence\nbetween the trained policy and the reference policy to the loss. The overall surrogate objective is:\nJGRPO(θ) =Eh\nq∼P(Q), {oi}G\ni=1∼πθold (O|q)\ni\n1\nG\nG\n∑\ni=1\n1\n|oi|\n|oi|\n∑\nt=1\n\b\nmin\n\u0000\nri,t(θ) ˆAi,t, clip (ri,t(θ), 1−ϵ, 1+ϵ) ˆAi,t\n\u0001\n− βDKL [πθ ∥ πref]\n\t\n,\n(3)\nwhere ri,t(θ) = πθ(oi,t|q,oi,<t)\nπθold (oi,t|q,oi,<t) , ϵ and β are hyper-parameters, and DKL denotes the KL divergence between\nthe learned policy and a reference policy πref.\n2.3 Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO)\nDecoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO) (Yu et al., 2025) is a recent RL\nmethod designed to address the unique challenges in LLM reasoning.\nFor each question q with gold answer a, DAPO samples a group of G outputs {oi}G\ni=1 from the old policy,\ncomputes their rewards, and maximizes the following surrogate objective:\nJDAPO(θ) =Eh\n(q,a)∼D, {oi}G\ni=1∼πθold (·|q)\ni\n1\n∑G\ni=1 |oi|\nG\n∑\ni=1\n|oi|\n∑\nt=1\nn\nmin\n\u0010\nri,t(θ) ˆAi,t, clip\n\u0010\nri,t(θ), 1−ϵlow, 1+ϵhigh\n\u0011\nˆAi,t\n\u0011o\n,\n(4)\nwhere ˆAi,t is the group-normalized advantage. In addition, DAPO decouples the upper and lower\nclipping ranges ( ϵlow, ϵhigh) to better support exploration, dynamically filters out samples where all\nresponses are correct or incorrect, aggregates losses at the token level, and applies special reward shaping\nfor overlong or truncated responses.\n3"}

Drawing from prior research and practical\nimplementations, we categorize widely used techniques as follows.\nBaseline Design. Baselines are crucial for reducing variance in policy gradient estimation. Recent\nstudies have proposed more effective formulations, such as using the mean reward within each group\nas the baseline (Shao et al., 2024) and computing the baseline for each sample as the average gradient\nestimate from other samples in the group (Ahmadian et al., 2024; Kool et al., 2019).\nClipping Strategies. Clipping controls excessive updates in policy optimization and can be applied to\ndifferent quantities, such as rewards, advantages, or ratios. Furthermore, the Clip Ratio Higher (Yu et al.,\n2025) method relaxes the upper bound in PPO’s ratio clipping to better preserve exploration.\nNormalization Strategies. Normalization of rewards or advantages helps stabilize gradient magnitudes.\nRepresentative approaches include: Batch-level Reward Normalization (Hu et al., 2025), Group-level Reward\nNormalization (Shao et al., 2024; Ahmadian et al., 2024), and Reward Shift without Standard Deviation (Liu\net al., 2025a), which removes the standard deviation term to avoid the difficulty bias.\nFiltering Strategies. Filtering out uninformative or undesirable samples prior to gradient computation.\nExamples include: Overlong Filtering (Yu et al., 2025) to remove responses exceeding predefined length\nlimits; Error Max Clip Mask and Right Min Clip Mask to filter overly incorrect or trivially correct samples;\nand Difficulty Mask (Yu et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025; Chu et al., 2025) to exclude samples outside a\ntargeted difficulty range.\nLoss Aggregation Granularity. The formulation of loss aggregation determines the relative weight\neach token contributes to the overall objective. Common approaches include: Token-level Loss computes\nper-token advantages to reduce length bias, while Sequence-level Loss aggregates at the sequence level.\nAdditional Loss Functions. Auxiliary losses can complement the primary objective and regularize\ntraining. KL Loss (Yu et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025a) constrains divergence from a reference policy, while\nSFT Loss (Zhang and Zuo, 2025) incorporates supervised fine-tuning objectives to preserve alignment.\nReward Design. Shaping the reward function can guide desired output properties. Common examples\ninclude: Length Penalty discourages excessively long outputs; Formatting Reward which encourages\noutputs that adhere to preferred structures such as boxed answers, bullet lists, or code-style formatting;\nLength-Dependent Accuracy Reward combines correctness with output length.\nThe above categories summarize the most prevalent improvement strategies for RL in LLM reasoning.\nIn this work, we focus on four key aspects: Normalization, Clipping, Masking, and Loss Aggregation, and\nconduct in-depth analyses of their mechanisms and practical utility.\n3 Experimental Designs\n3.1 Experimental Setup\nTraining Algorithm: We utilize the open-sourced ROLL framework1 (Wang et al., 2025), an efficient\nand scalable platform specifically designed for reinforcement learning optimization in LLMs, to conduct\nall experiments. Besides, we adopt PPO loss (Schulman et al., 2017), with advantage values computed\nusing the REINFORCE algorithm (Sutton et al., 1999) as the unified and naive RL baseline. To ensure that\nthe batch size for global sampling is consistent with existing research, i.e., 1024, we set the rollout batch\nsize to 128 and sample 8 responses for each prompt, with a maximum response length of 8192 tokens.\nThe learning rate is set to 1e − 6. For text generation, we use a top_p value of 0.99, a top_k value of 100,\nand a temperature of 0.99.\nBase Models: To comprehensively evaluate reinforcement learning (RL) techniques across parameter"}

To com-\nprehensively examine how problem difficulty affects the RL technique’s performance, we randomly\nsample from the datasets while removing an excessive proportion of examples whose ground-truth label\nis simply “True” or “False”. Because we identify the ostensible positive phenomenon wherein models\nproduce correct binary answers from erroneous reasoning chains, introducing noisy supervision that\ncompromises training quality (please refer to Appendix B.2 for case studies). Figure 2 visualizes the\ndifficulty across the training dataset assessed by GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024).\n• Easy Data : We randomly sample 5, 000 entries from SimpleRL-Zoo-Data-Easy, which consists of\nproblems drawn from GSM8K and MATH-500-level1.\n• Medium Data: We select the 5, 000 easiest examples from the DeepMath-103k dataset, based on\ntheir assigned difficulty annotations.\n• Hard Data: We randomly sample 5, 000 entries from DeepMath-103k, with sampling probability\nproportional to each entry’s assigned difficulty level.\nEvaluation Benchmark: All the experiments are conducted on six math datasets. i.e., MATH-500 (Hendrycks\net al., 2021), OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024), MinervaMath (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), and subsets of\nstandardized examinations (AIME24-25, AMC23).

Specifically, we analyze\nthe training convergence patterns through loss dynam-\nics, accuracy trajectories, and generalization gaps, with\nthree tiers of complexity ( Easy, Medium, Hard ). The\ndetailed learning curves are shown in Figure 3.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that, as the num-\nber of training epochs increases, the model exhibits\nmarkedly different accuracy trajectories across training\nsets of different difficulty levels. Furthermore, when confronted with more challenging samples, the\nmodel often fits complex reasoning patterns by generating more tokens.\nWhen focusing on the differences in learning efficiency between the unaligned Base model and the aligned\nmodel under the same experimental setting (as shown in Figure 3), the aligned models demonstrated a\nsubstantially higher initial accuracy and produced responses with a significantly longer average token\nlength in the early stages of training. However, the performance improvement from additional learning\nsteps of the aligned model was relatively modest, yielding only about a 2% increase in accuracy. This\nresult suggests that the current RL4LLM algorithm offers a slight improvement for aligned models that\nare already highly optimized.\n4 Analysis\n4.1 Normalization\nAdvantage normalization is a well-established technique for reducing gradient variance and stabilizing\npolicy optimization (Zheng et al., 2023), and it has become a standard component of RL training pipelines\nfor language models.

(5)\nIn contrast, batch normalization computes the reward over a rollout batch of size N and K sampled\ntrajectories. The normalized advantage for the i-th response is:\nAbatch\ni =\nri − mean({rj}N∗K\nj=1 )\nstd({rj}N∗K\nj=1 ) (6)\n4.1.1 Advantage normalization is sensitive to reward mechanisms\nTakeaway 1\nGroup-level normalization demonstrates robust efficiency across different reward settings.Batch-\nlevel normalisation provides more stable improvement under large scale reward setting.\nTo systematically evaluate the impact of advantage normalization on PPO variants with a value function\nusing the Monte Carlo return target, we conducted experiments under a unified training framework,\nexploring three settings: no normalization, batch-level normalization, and group-level normalization.\nTo highlight the differential impacts of the normalization techniques during training, we selected the\nQwen3-base series models due to their low initial scores and high improvement potential (Yang et al.,\n2025). This choice ensures a fair comparison by minimizing confounding factors from alignment or prior\noptimization. Focusing on model scale as a key variable, we evaluate small (4B) and medium-sized (8B)\nmodels to empirically assess whether normalization techniques interact with model capacity. This ap-\nproach allows us to derive practical insights into normalization strategies across different computational\nbudgets and architectures.\nUnder the default setting of the reward mechanism, i.e., R ∈ {0, 1}3, when analyzing the performance in\nFigure 4, it can be concluded that both advantage normalization techniques can significantly influence\nthe model’s convergence speed, performance stability, and final outcomes. Specifically, on both model\nsizes, group-level normalization consistently achieves more stable training dynamics and higher final\nperformance compared to both batch-level normalization and no normalization. Batch-level normaliza-\ntion exhibits high sensitivity to reward distribution skew, often leading to performance collapse under an\nimbalanced batch situation, where a few outlier samples dominate the advantage estimates.\nHowever, when we changed the reward mechanism to the larger scale of R ∈ {−1, 1}4, batch-level\nnormalization regained its effectiveness, demonstrating a significant improvement in policy learning, as\nshown in Figure 5. The above experiment fully demonstrates the sensitivity of the advantage normaliza-\ntion technique to the reward mechanism.\n4.1.2 Impact of the standard deviation term in advantage normalization\nTakeaway 2\nRemoving the standard deviation when reward distributions are highly concentrated (e.g., easy\ntraining dataset) enhances the stability and effectiveness of model training.\nThe previous section highlighted the sensitivity of various normalization techniques to the reward scale.\nThus, a question naturally emerged: what drives this phenomenon? A plausible explanation is that different\nreward scales directly impact the calculation of the standard deviation, thereby altering the strength\nof the normalization. In particular, when model responses within a prompt group yield highly similar\nrewards, e.g., when the responses are almost all correct or all incorrect, the resulting standard deviation\nbecomes extremely small. In such cases, dividing by this small standard deviation during normalization\n3R ∈ {0, 1} represents the default rule-based binary reward mechanism, where a value of 1 is assigned to\ntrajectories that generate correct answers, and a value of 0 is assigned to incorrect ones.\n4R ∈ {−1, 1} further increases the magnitude of reward differences compared to the default mechanism, where a\nvalue of 1 is assigned to trajectories that generate correct answers, and a value of -1 is assigned to incorrect ones.\n7"}

This can be formalized as:\nAstd¬\nk = rk − mean({rj}K\nj=1). (7)\nWe separately recorded the accuracy after training on simple and difficult data. The curves of easy data\nin Figure 6 show that the policy rapidly converges to highly consistent behaviors, leading to a highly\nconcentrated distribution of reward values. Correspondingly, the standard deviation of the reward\ndistribution swiftly declines to a low value. Applying standard deviation-based normalization in this\nsetting results in an exceedingly small denominator, which excessively amplifies reward and advantage\nvalues. This, in turn, induces abnormally large gradients, destabilizes training, and can even trigger\ngradient explosions. Therefore, these experimental results empirically verify our conjecture that the\nstandard deviation term is the key mechanism for the advantage normalization.\nTo further solidify our conclusion, we add a set of comparisons based on the hard dataset. We observe that\nthe standard deviation of rewards remains comparatively high during training. As a result, both mean-\nonly normalization and standard deviation based normalization yield similar efficiency, and training\nremains stable regardless of the normalization style. Consequently, the choice of normalization style has\nlittle impact on convergence or overall performance under such a smooth reward distribution.\nIn summary, our experiments and analysis underscore that, in scenarios where reward distributions are\nhighly concentrated, omitting the standard deviation from advantage normalization effectively prevents\nabnormal gradient amplification, thereby improving the stability and robustness of model training.\nHowever, for tasks characterized by inherently higher reward variance, either normalization approach is\ngenerally sufficient to maintain stable optimization.\n9"}

This leads to the final requirement: Is there a more robust\nand effective combination of mean and standard deviation for reward shaping? To explore this, we\nadopted the stable group-level mean calculation method demonstrated in section 4.1.1, paired with two\napproaches for computing the standard deviation: local (group-level) and global (batch-level). We then\nevaluated the performance of these combinations across two model sizes.\nThe results, presented in Figures 7, reveal that global-level calculation exhibits a clear advantage. We\nattribute this to the batch-level standard deviation providing stronger normalization by effectively\nreducing gradient magnitudes, thereby preventing excessive policy updates. This approach aligns more\neffectively with the biased reward signals common in sparse rewards and coarse-grained advantage\nfitting, resulting in more stable and robust learning behavior. Furthermore, our experimental results\nsupport a claim from Hu et al. (2025) that batch-level normalization, or even subtracting the local mean\nand dividing by the batch standard deviation in certain scenarios, performs better.\n4.2 Clip-Higher\nWhile the Clip mechanism enhances PPO training stability (Huang et al., 2024b), it introduces critical\nchallenges in LLM-based text generation. Specifically, it disproportionately suppresses low-probability\ntokens (Yu et al., 2025), leading to entropy collapse, i.e., a state where strategies become deterministic and\nlack diversity (Jin et al., 2024). This suppression creates a harmful positive feedback loop: as training\nprogresses, entropy decreases, exploration shrinks, high-probability patterns are further reinforced,\nand entropy declines even more. Such behavior severely hinders performance on complex reasoning\ntasks, where novel path exploration is essential. To address this, the Clip-Higher mechanism is widely\nintroduced into the training objective, which can be formalized as:\nJDAPO (θ) = (ri,t(θ), 1− εlow , 1+ εhigh ). (8)\nεhigh denotes the upper bound of the Clip mechanism and εlow represents the lower bound. Unlike\nthe original clip that enforces proportional fairness, Clip-Higher introduces a higher upper bound for\nadvantage, giving low-probability tokens more improving space. By expanding exploration potential\nin low-probability regions, this technique effectively mitigates entropy collapse. However, the lack of\nin-depth analysis of the underlying mechanism and the absence of detailed usage guidelines have left\npractitioners confused about the appropriate scenarios for using Clip-Higher, as well as the ideal upper\nbound settings under different conditions. In this section, we address the aforementioned remaining\nissues through a series of comprehensive experiments.\n0 200 400 600 800\nStep\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30Entropy\nQwen3-4B-Base\n0 200 400 600 800\nStep\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\nQwen3-8B-Base\n0 250 500 750\nStep\n0.09\n0.12\n0.15\n0.18\n0.21\n0.24\nQwen3-4B\n0 250 500 750\nStep\n0.14\n0.16\n0.18\n0.20\n0.22\nQwen3-8B\nupper clip=0.2 upper clip=0.28\nFigure 8: Entropy comparison across different models with Clip-Higher.

For the base models, adjusting the upper clipping value yields minor\neffects on policy entropy and even damages the performance compared to the vanilla policy (as shown\nin the top 2 rows of Figure 9). In contrast, aligned models exhibit a markedly different response:\nraising the upper clipping bound notably slows the entropy collapse, leading to consistent performance\nimprovements in downstream evaluation metrics (refer to the middle and bottom rows in Figure 9).\nThis disparity can be attributed to several underlying factors. First, the base models operate with a low\npolicy clipping rate, approximately 0.003, which indicates only minimal deviation between successive\npolicies. Moreover, the relatively naive policy expressiveness limits these base models’ capacity for\nexploration, hindering the discovery of high-reward trajectories. Consequently, a higher clipping upper\nbound yields negligible improvements in learning dynamics.\nOn the other hand, aligned models that leverage advanced pre-training techniques or post-training\nenhancements demonstrate superior reasoning capabilities and generalization performance (Yang et al.,\n2025). As shown in Figure 10, compared to the base model, the aligned model has very few preferred\ntokens with high probability in the initial stage. Token distributions for larger-scale models are provided\nin Appendix D. Therefore, a higher clipping upper bound can effectively bridge the probability gap\nbetween tokens and alleviate the entropy collapse. For these models, raising the upper bound expands the\npermissible range of policy updates, which in turn facilitates more diverse action sampling and enhances\nexploratory behavior during training. This mechanism preserves higher entropy while simultaneously\nincreasing the probability of identifying optimal solutions, as evidenced by improved evaluation metrics.\n[0,0.3) [0.3,0.6) [0.6,0.85) [0.85,0.95) [0.95,0.99) [0.99,1.0)\nProbability Intervals\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100Proportion (%)\n1.7 1.3 1.7 1.6 2.0\n91.7\n2.3 1.9 2.5 2.2 2.8\n88.2\nQwen3-4B-Base\nupper clip=0.20\nupper clip=0.28\n[0,0.3) [0.3,0.6) [0.6,0.85) [0.85,0.95) [0.95,0.99) [0.99,1.0)\nProbability Intervals\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n5.8 6.9\n10.3 10.2 12.9\n53.8\n6.7 8.5\n12.3 11.3 12.9\n48.3\nQwen3-4B\nupper clip=0.20\nupper clip=0.28\nFigure 10: Predicted probability distributions of Qwen3-4B-Base (left) and Qwen3-4B (right) under two\nclipping upper bound ∈ {0.20, 0.28}.\n4.2.2 Analyzing the effectiveness of Clip-Higher from a linguistic perspective\nTakeaway 5\nTraditional clippingmay restrict the model’s capacity to generate innovative reasoning structures.\nClipping higher allows the model to explore a broader range of discourse reasoning structures.\nBuilding on our token-level demonstration of Clip-Higher’s behavior in section 4.2.1, we now analyze its\nimpact on reasoning logic through token-level linguistics. As illustrated in Figure 11, setting an upper\nbound to 0.2 imposes stringent constraints on policy updates by limiting substantial probability deviations\nfor individual tokens. Under these stricter conditions, our analysis reveals that clipping predominantly\naffects connective tokens such as “ therefore”, “if ”, and “ but”. These tokens frequently appear at the\nbeginnings of sentences, serving as key semantic markers or transition words within dialog generation.\nSuch connectors often introduce new directions in reasoning. However, their probability ratios between\nupdated and old policies frequently exceed clipping thresholds, triggering aggressive suppression in\nPPO optimization. While this traditional clipping ensures stability in the overall token distribution, it\nmay restrict the model’s capacity to generate innovative or diverse argumentative reasoning structures\nby constraining flexibility in the use of discourse-level connectives."}

This transition allows the model to\nexplore a broader range of discourse reasoning structures and promotes diversity in response generation.\nBesides, the remaining clipping action on common function words serves to maintain the stability of the\ncore sentence structure.\n4.2.3 How to set the upper bound for advantage clipping\nTakeaway 6\nThere appears to be a “scaling law” between the performance and the upper bound of the clipping\non the small-sized model, which does not exist on larger models.\nSection 4.2.1 verifies that Clip-Higher showed significant improvements on aligned models. However,\nmost current works directly set the upper bound of Clip to the default value of 0.28 from (Yu et al.,\n2025). However, we believe that different models have different preferences for this parameter. To verify\nthis conjecture, we empirically searched for the hyperparameter settings applicable to different aligned\nmodels by uniformly setting the upper bound of Clip. Specifically, we set the exploration range of the\nClip upper bound from the default threshold of 0.2 from traditional Clip to 0.32 (beyond the widely used\nupper bound 0.28). We employed two sizes of models and uniformly evaluated their learning capabilities\nunder different settings.\nThe results in Figure 12 show that for the small-sized model (4B), the model performance gradually\nimproves as the upper bound of the clip increases. And at 0.32, it demonstrates the best performance\ncompared to other settings. On the other hand, for larger model sizes (8B), gradually increasing the upper\nbound of the clip does not show a progressive improvement. The performance is more prominent when\nthe upper bound is set as 0.28.\n4.3 Loss Aggregation\nThe strategy of loss aggregation directly determines the contribution of each sample or token to the\noverall gradient during optimization (Liu et al., 2025b). Common strategies include token-level and\nsequence-level aggregation. The sequence-level aggregation adopted by GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) first\naverages the loss across all tokens within each sample, then averages these per-response losses across\nthe batch, thereby assigning equal weight to each response regardless of its length. However, Yu et al.\n(2025) highlights a flaw in this method: longer responses possess a diminished influence per token on the\n14"}

The evaluation comprehensively assesses the effectiveness of these methods from the\nperspective of model type.\n4.3.1 Does token-level loss aggregation suit all settings?\nTakeaway 7\nCompared to sequence-level calculation, token-level loss proves to be more effective on Base\nmodels, while showing limited improvement on Instruct models.\nTo systematically evaluate the effectiveness of different loss aggregation strategies, we compare token-\nlevel and sequence-level loss aggregation on both base and aligned versions of Qwen3-8B, as shown in\nFigures 13 and 18. For base models, token-level loss consistently improves convergence, peak accuracy,\nand robustness by ensuring each token contributes equally to the optimization signal, especially on\nchallenging datasets. However, as illustrated in Figure 13 (bottom 2 rows), this advantage does not\nshow in aligned models. In fact, sequence-level aggregation outperforms token-level loss across most\ndatasets and settings, both in convergence speed and final accuracy. Further analysis reveals that aligned\nmodels already possess strong and stable reasoning, making the equalization of token-level gradients\nunnecessary or even detrimental. In these cases, sequence-level aggregation better preserves the structure\nand consistency of high-quality, aligned outputs.\n15"}

However, recent\nstudies have revealed that in more complex reasoning tasks, this strategy can prematurely end multi-step\ntail reasoning processes, particularly noticeable in the early training stages. Consequently, coherent and\nwell-structured reasoning is often cut short before reaching the final answer, causing them to be falsely\nlabeled as negative samples by the model. This noise, akin to penalties, can contaminate the training\nsignal, reducing sample utilization efficiency and learning effectiveness.\nTo address this issue, the technique namedoverlong filtering has been introduced (Yu et al., 2025). This\nmethod involves masking the reward signal of excessively long responses to preserve training loss\nrobustness and prevent degradation of reasoning behavior (He et al., 2025b). Despite its benefits, there\nremains a lack of detailed analysis regarding the sensitivity of this technique to the mask threshold,\nleading to confusion among practitioners.\nThis section aims to analyze the impact of the overlong filtering on performance across diverse datasets\nunder varying maximum generation length settings. By doing so, we seek to identify the suitable\nscenarios for applying this technique.\n16"}

However, with a longer filter threshold, i.e., 20k tokens, the benefits\nderived from this technique diminish significantly. After checking the response lengths, a discernible\npattern emerges to explain this phenomenon. When operating under the threshold of 20k, models trained\nwith the overlong filtering strategy exhibit a tendency to generate longer responses in comparison to the\nvanilla policy. Conversely, a short filter threshold, i.e., 8k, makes the model generate shorter responses.\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\nStep\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0Repeat Ratio\n8k  (Reward=1)\n20k (Reward=1)\n8k  (Reward=0)\n20k (Reward=0)\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600\nStep\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5Repeat Ratio\nw/o overlong filtering (Reward=1)\nw/ overlong filtering (Reward=1)\nw/o overlong filtering (Reward=0)\nw/ overlong filtering (Reward=0)\nFigure 15: Left: Comparison of repeat ratios among four types of generations, i.e., correct (reward = 1)\nand incorrect (reward = 0) generations under different maximum generation lengths. Right: Comparison\nof repeat ratios among truncated samples with or without overlong filtering strategy. The statistical form\nof the repetition rate can be found in Appendix B.1.\nTo further investigate this effect, Figure 15 (Left) shows the distribution of filtered responses exceeding\nthe maximum length. Notably, in the 20k setting, both correct and incorrect samples are filtered more\nfrequently due to repetitive or non-terminating outputs, a hallmark of degenerate generation. This indi-\ncates that, with higher length limits, the overlong filtering strategy primarily filters out unproductive or\n“negative” samples that contribute little to model learning. As illustrated in Figure 15 (Right), we observed\nthat during RL training on models fine-tuned with instructions, the proportion of “repetitive but unable\nto terminate normally” samples within the overall set of overlong samples gradually increased as training\nprogressed. This indicates a degradation in the model’s ability to accurately model end-of-sequence\n(EOS) tokens, leading to behavioral defects in the inference stage, such as output redundancy and hard\nin terminating the generation. After introducing the overlong filtering mechanism, the proportion of\nabnormal samples that are “repetitive but unable to terminate” significantly decreased during training.\nThis shift suggests that the model can more accurately distinguish between “completed generation” and\n“truncated generation” samples during training, effectively avoiding invalid learning from truncated\nsamples. Furthermore, this mechanism may unlock the policies’ ability to accurately model termination\nbehaviors during generation, enabling them to appropriately ignore unfinished inference samples, rather\nthan mistakenly penalizing them as negative examples.\n5 A simple combination: Lite PPO\nBuilding on the in-depth mechanism analysis and empirical evaluations presented in previous sections,\nwe derive two key technique guidelines for non-aligned models: (i) For small and medium-sized\nnon-aligned models, i.e., 4B-Base and 8B-Base, the technique that can provide significant performance\nimprovement is the advantage normalization introduced in section 4.1.3. This technique shapes sparse\nrewards into more robust guiding signals through group-level mean calculation and batch-level standard\ndeviation calculation.

In contrast, other policies collapse rapidly after reaching their peak.\nThis significant advantage results from the normalization technique introduced in Takeaway 3, which\neffectively counters the interference induced by homogeneous reward distributions characteristic of\ndatasets with non-uniform reward levels (easy and hard). We further evaluate Lite PPO on larger\nbase models. As shown in Figure 16, when training 8B-Base models with inherent long-tail generation\ncapabilities on the hard dataset, Lite PPO also demonstrates superior performance. This improvement\nstems from Lite PPO eliminating overlong filtering (which typically restricts small models’ ability to\ngenerate complex long-tail outputs; Takeaway 8), and shifting to token-level loss aggregation (which\nshows better efficiency on base models; Takeaway 7).\n6 Conclusion\nThe rapid advancement of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing large language models (LLMs) has\nushered in a transformative era for complex reasoning tasks. However, the proliferation of RL4LLM\nresearch has also introduced significant challenges, including conflicting methodologies and a lack of\ncohesive guidelines for technique selection. This work addresses these critical issues by conducting a\nsystematic, reproducible evaluation of prominent RL techniques under a unified framework, revealing\nkey insights that resolve existing ambiguities and streamline practical implementation.\nBy disentangling the theoretical and practical mechanisms of techniques like normalization, clipping,\nand filtering, our study provides actionable guidelines to demystify their applicability across diverse\nscenarios. Crucially, we show that simplicity can outperform complexity: a minimalist approach (i.e., Lite\nPPO) combining only two core techniques achieves superior performance over algorithms cluttered with\nredundant components. This finding challenges the prevailing trend of over-engineering RL pipelines and\nunderscores the importance of contextual adaptability in technique selection. Our work not only resolves\nthe current fragmentation in RL4LLM practice but also lays a foundation for developing standardized\nframeworks that balance theoretical rigor with engineering efficiency.\n19"}

However, conclusions may vary across LLM families due to inherent differences in pre-\ntraining processes and architectures. The prevailing trend of model closed-sourcing, often driven by\ncommercial or strategic considerations, significantly impedes model-family-level technical analysis.\nTherefore, we advocate for increased disclosure of implementation details in future technical reports\nwithin the industry. This transparency is crucial to bridge the understanding gap between academia and\nindustry, enabling the community to pool collective insights in artificial intelligence.\n7 Future work\nWe envision this work as the starting point of a sustained effort to guide the evolution of reinforcement\nlearning for LLMs along principled and empirically grounded trajectories. Our future research will focus\non: (1) continue to monitoring and critically evaluating developments in RL4LLM, distilling emerging\npractices into coherent, evidence-based guidelines for both academic and industrial practitioners; (2)\nleveraging the proposed ROLL framework to consolidate diverse RL algorithms and optimization\nstrategies into a unified, modular suite, enabling flexible composition and benchmarking within a\nconsistent training infrastructure; (3) continuing to explore streamlined RL algorithms that deliver\nstrong empirical performance with minimal engineering overhead. These directions align with our\nlong-term vision to provide the community with clear and reliable guidance, driving the field toward\nrobust, adaptable, and broadly beneficial progress, while advancing RL4LLM through both algorithmic\ninnovations and comprehensive framework support.\nReferences\nSiwei Wu, Zhongyuan Peng, Xinrun Du, Tuney Zheng, Minghao Liu, Jialong Wu, Jiachen Ma, Yizhi\nLi, Jian Yang, Wangchunshu Zhou, Qunshu Lin, Junbo Zhao, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Wenhao Huang,\nGe Zhang, Chenghua Lin, and Jiaheng Liu.

Introduction\nAs of 2025, Amazon has deployed hundreds of thousands of robots throughout its global network\nof fulfillment and sortation warehouses (see Figure 1). Each fulfillment warehouse floor must\ncoordinate its fleet of mobile robots to transport shelves of inventory between storage locations\nand workstations to complete customer orders, while on sortation floors the robots pickup\npackages at workstations and drop them off at the right chute for their destination. Effective\ncoordination requires an understanding of complex multi-agent dynamics to enable proactive\nplanning that avoids congestion and deadlocks, maximizes throughput, and completes customer\norders on time.\nThe discovery that scaling up deep neural networks and their training data can unlock unprece-\ndented capabilities in natural language understanding [ 1], speech recognition [ 2], vision [3], and\nreasoning [4] has recently led to efforts to apply the same data-driven scaling approach to robotic\nsystems [5–8]. Inspired by these efforts, we explore the design space of multi-agent foundation\nmodels to support the development of the next generation of robot fleet coordination algorithms.\nJust as foundation models pretrained on simple tasks such as masked text prediction can be\nadapted to applications via supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, knowledge distilla-\ntion, or in-context learning, our multi-agent fleet models are designed to serve as a foundation\nfor many applications in our warehouses, such as congestion forecasting, adaptive routing, and\nproactive rescheduling.\nBy using multi-agent forecasting as a pretraining objective, we expect these foundation models\nto learn how task assignments shape movement patterns, how congestion forms, and how\narXiv:2508.08574v1  [cs.RO]  12 Aug 2025"}

With a large deployed fleet, multiple generations of\nmobile robots, hundreds of warehouses with diverse layouts and processes, and daily, weekly,\nand seasonal operational cycles, we expect our dataset to contain the kind of diversity that is\nnecessary to provide a strong foundation for downstream tasks.\nThis paper aims to address the following question: What are the most important architectural\ndesign choices for multi-agent foundation models, and how do they impact prediction accuracy\nand scaling? Specifically, we vary and study the impact of the extent of temporal and spatial\ncontext, the choice of uniform temporal snapshots or event-based updates, the choice of agent-\ncentric or global state representations, the choice of state prediction or action prediction, and\nhow information is propagated across time, space, and agents. The result is DEEP FLEET , a suite\nof four model architectures, each embodying a distinctive inductive bias for learning how mobile\nrobot fleets move in structured warehouse environments (see Table 1 in Section 3):\n• The robot-centric (RC) model conditions a causal transformer on each robot’ s history of its\nown state, actions, and its local neighborhood to predict each robot’ s next action.\n• The robot-floor (RF) model uses cross-attention between robot features and floor features\nto jointly leverage neighborhood information and global context.\n• The image-floor (IF) model uses convolutional encoding over an image-like grid of the\nentire floor with separate channels for different robot and floor features.\n• Finally, thegraph-floor (GF) model uses graph neural network (GNN) and edge-conditioned\ntransformer layers to capture robot-to-robot and robot-to-floor relationships.\nOur experimental results suggest that the robot-centric and graph-floor models, with limited\nspatial context, use their parameters more efficiently than the image-floor and robot-floor models,\nwhich provide full spatial context to each robot. They also show that convolutional features\nstruggle to capture the dynamics of the floor, at least in a representation in which each robot\nis modeled as a single pixel. Initial scaling experiments for the robot-centric and graph-floor\nmodels suggest that there is room to scale up model size and dataset usage to improve model\nperformance. We were able to extrapolate scaling curves from two orders of magnitude for the\ngraph-floor model, while further experiments are needed to determine quantitative scaling laws\nfor the robot-centric model.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.

We offer concluding remarks in Section 9.\n2. Related Work\nMulti-Agent Trajectory Forecasting. Significant work has been dedicated to modeling multi-\nagent interactions in trajectory forecasting, particularly in domains such as pedestrian motion\nprediction, autonomous driving, and social navigation. Early works such as Social-LSTM [9] and\nSocial-GAN [10] captured inter-agent dynamics via recurrent neural networks with interaction-\naware pooling. Transformer-based architectures [11, 12], variational models [13, 14], and hybrid\nmethods combining GNNs with probabilistic forecasting [15, 16] have since improved general-\nization and multimodal prediction capabilities. However, these models are primarily applied\nto small-scale environments with limited agent counts and are not designed to scale to the\nthousands of agents encountered in warehouse scenarios.\nRobotic Fleet Management in Warehouses. Research in warehouse robotics has historically\nfocused on task assignment, multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and traffic management. Classic\nheuristic-based methods such as conflict-based search (CBS) [17] and prioritized planning [18]\nprovide strong guarantees but struggle to scale in dense, real-time environments. Learning-\nbased alternatives have emerged to address path planning and task reallocation [19, 20], but they\ntypically lack generalization to diverse layouts and fail to incorporate long-horizon prediction.\nThese methods are often designed for specific optimization objectives rather than as general-\npurpose predictive models. Recent work [21] introduces scalable imitation learning for lifelong\nmulti-agent path finding, enabling robust coordination of up to 10,000 robots by combining\nefficient communication and global guidance to outperform both learning- and search-based\nbaselines. Similarly, MAPF-GPT [22] leverages transformer-based imitation learning to efficiently\nsolve large-scale pathfinding problems, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse\nenvironments. While these learning-based approaches rely on simulated data, we use a unique\nlarge-scale dataset of real warehouse operations.\nSpatiotemporal Modeling and Representations. Recent work in spatiotemporal modeling has\nproduced powerful neural representations for structured environments. TrajectoryCNN [ 23],\nScene-Transformer [24], and ST-GNNs [25] illustrate the utility of combining convolutional or\ngraph-based spatial reasoning with temporal sequence modeling. In robotics, structured state-\nspace models (SSMs) [ 26, 27] and graph-based encodings [ 28] have improved data efficiency\nand temporal coherence. Notably, GraphCast [ 29] and GenCast [ 30] have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of graph-based and generative models for large-scale spatiotemporal prediction,\nrespectively excelling at deterministic and probabilistic forecasting in highly complex systems.\nNonetheless, these methods often lack scalability, task generalization, or the integration of diverse\nspatial and temporal contexts required for warehouse-scale fleet modeling.\nScaling Laws and Compute-Optimal Models. The rise of foundation models was enabled by\nempirical studies [31] that demonstrated that language model performance followed predictable\nscaling laws with respect to compute, model size, and data. After further refinement [32], these\nprinciples have been used to inform the scaling of large multi-modal models such as PaLM [33]\nand LLaMA [34].\n3"}

Our work complements and extends\nthese efforts by addressing fleet-scale modeling across thousands of agents in industrial settings.\n3. Problem Formulation\nWe consider a generalized warehouse environment populated by a large fleet of mobile robots.\nThe layout is modeled as a directed graph G = (V,E), where each vertex v ∈V represents one of\nM defined locations on the floor, and each directed edge (u, v) ∈ E denotes an admissible motion\nbetween these locations. The fleet with N mobile robots (N ≪ M) traverses this graph to execute\nlogistics tasks issued by a centralized coordinator, which involve picking up an object from one\nvertex, carrying it through the graph, and eventually unloading the object at another vertex.\nOn our storage floors, objects are pods containing inventory (see Figure 2, top). Loading a pod\nrequires a robot to dock under it and actuate a lifting mechanism. Pods are stored in designated\nareas on the floor, and robots transport them between storage and workstations where items\nare picked out of the pod or stowed into it. On sortation floors, robots bring packages from\npickup stations to drop-off locations (see Figure 2, bottom). These robots carry one package at a\ntime and are equipped with a conveyor belt, which they use to eject the package at the drop-off\nlocation. Storage and sortation robots have similar footprints and dynamics, but the emerging\ndynamics of the two types of floors differ: movement on storage floors tends to be more spatially\nconstrained by pod storage areas, while congestion on sortation floors can emerge from spikes in\ndemand for certain drop-off locations.\nDEEP FLEET models are trained using production data from both types of floors, using the follow-\ning representation to unify both storage and sortation floors.\nRobot state. At time t, each robot i is described by a state vector si\nt = (pi\nt ,θi\nt , g i\nt ,ℓi\nt ), where pi\nt ∈V\nis its current position, θi\nt its heading, g i\nt its goal location, and ℓi\nt is its load status (whether the\nrobot is carrying a pod/package).\nVertex features. Vertex features include the vertex location on the floor in a global reference\nframe, and whether the vertex is used for travel, charging, or other tasks. For storage floors, a\nvertex may be designated for pod storage or for picking/stowing from a pod. On sortation floors,\nvertices can be pickup or drop-off locations.\nFloor state. Aggregating over all vertices yields a floor state St ∈ RM×d , where each row encodes\nstatic vertex features and any dynamic robot features associated with that vertex (with feature\ndimension d). This unified notation accommodates both floor-centric views (a dense vertex grid)\nand robot-centric views (sparse robot states mapped onto vertices).\n4"}

We used model inference to iteratively\nroll out robot trajectories 60 seconds into the future for each sample in the test partition of the\ndataset, and then compared them to the ground truth trajectories using the following metrics:\n• Dynamic time warping (DTW) distance [42] across multiple dimensions: robot position and\nspeed, state, and timing of load and unload events. Its units are the same as the underlying\nmeasurement, e.g., the DTW error for position is in meters, and measures the average distance\nbetween the true and estimated trajectory after the optimal temporal alignment is found.\n• Congestion delay error (CDE), or the relative error between the proportion of time robots are\ndelayed by others from an inference rollout and the ground truth. These delays are calculated\nas ( ttotal − tfree_flow)/ttotal, where ttotal is the actual travel time of a set of robot trajectories\nand tfree_flow is the counterfactual travel time if robots could occupy the same space and not\ninterfere with the motion of others.\nDTW measures the ability of the models to predict the motion and state of the robots, which\nwas the pretraining objective for all of the models. Congestion delay is a stand-in for the class\nof operational metrics we want the model to be able to predict and eventually optimize; CDE\nmeasures the error in a model’ s ability to generate floor dynamics that have the right amount of\ncongestion.\nTable 2 presents the results. Overall, the RC model achieved the best performance across the\nmost metrics. The RF model was able to achieve strong performance on state and timing error,\nthough with a higher parameter count. Meanwhile, the GF model is fairly competitive despite its\nlow parameter count. The IF model struggled to accurately model the dynamics, and qualitatively\nthe rollouts included large jumps in robot positions from one second to the next.\nThe models were sized to fit on the available hardware during this phase of the project, and the\nvarying architectures caused big differences in the model sizes that makes direct comparison\ndifficult. However, we can still draw some conclusions from these results. First, we now believe\nthat the image-based approach that treats each location as a pixel and uses convolutional features\n7"}

Training Objective\nThe model is trained using behavior cloning with teacher forcing.

By decoupling the environment into structured object tokens and condition-\ning on ego-centric views, the model supports generalization across different robot instances,\nfloor geometries, and task types. Its translation- and rotation-invariant representation reduces\nsample complexity and facilitates large-scale training with shared parameters across robot units.\nMoreover, the autoregressive formulation enables multi-step rollout and simulation of agent\nbehavior for long-horizon forecasting.\n11"}

The model utilizes a Transformer Encoder to\nbuild the latent space for the robot’ s localized state, and robot tokens are passed to a Decoder\nTransformer to generate actions autoregressively.\n5.3. Inference Rollout\nAt inference time the same RC model is applied in parallel to every robot on the floor. Given\nthe current floor state St , we construct independent neighborhood windows o1\nt−K :t , .. .,oN\nt−K :t\nand obtain action distributions ˆa1\nt , .. ., ˆaN\nt in a single batched forward pass. Since this model\npredicts actions only, an environment model is needed to evolve the state. We use a deterministic\nenvironment that operates on the robots sequentially. For each time step, each robot attempts to\napply its action, which may require reserving a set of vertices to move through. If any of those\nvertices is already reserved, the robot executes a wait action instead; otherwise it reserves the\nnecessary vertices and updates its position. Aggregating all accepted state transitions yields\nthe new floor state St+1, which then seeds the subsequent prediction step. Because weights are\nshared across all N agents, the overall computation scales linearly with fleet size.\n6. Robot-floor Model\nThe robot-floor (RF) architecture (Figure 8) occupies the fixed-time, synchronous corner of the\ndesign matrix. At each time step t, system state is factorized into two heterogeneous token sets\nconsisting of N robot tokens ri ,t and M contextual floor tokens xj,t that correspond to a semi-\nstatic, physical floor elements that do not require prediction, but do impact fleet movement, such\nas vertex type, graph edges, objects and their locations. The model decodes each robot token ri ,t\ninto an action token ai ,t after conditioning on robot-to-robot context and floor-to-robot context,\nvia self-attention and cross-attention layers, respectively.\nEach robot feature ri concatenates absolute pose, target location, state (laden/unladen), and\nrobot type identifiers. Each context feature concatenates absolute position, object properties,\nvertex type, and graph edge features. Raw features are then embedded via learnable projections\nφ : Rdr →Rd and ψ : Rdx →Rd , after which they share a common latent dimension d.\nIsolating the N -token robot stream Rt from the much longer M-token context stream Xt helps\nreduce quadratic self-attention cost from O(M2) to O(N 2) (two orders of magnitude on a typical\nfloor). Robots still access the full floor snapshot through a single cross-attention pass of cost\n12"}

The model accepts an input sequence of robot tokens\nthat self-attend to each other and cross-attend to a sequence of fiducial tokens before decoding\nthe next action at the next time step. This figure depicts the decoder-only variant, which we\nexplain in section 6.1.\nO(N M), which also injects rich relational features such as edge distance or path cost [44, 45]. This\nenables global context where all robots can, in principle, attend to every object on the warehouse\nfloor (inventory, other robots, vertices and their connectivity), enabling long-range contextual\nunderstanding of fleet behavior. The context encoder can append new modalities (e.g., no-go\nzones) to Xt without touching the robot decoder, and the same model generalizes to arbitrary\nrobot counts or floor sizes simply by changing N and M.\n6.1. Model Framework\nThe RF model treats next-action prediction as a sequence transduction task, mapping an input\nsequence of robot states to an output sequence of actions: ( r1,. .. ,rN ) 7→ (a1,. .. ,aN ). To learn\nthis mapping, interactions among robot and context tokens are modeled by two attention mech-\nanisms. Self-attention among all robot tokens allows the model to learn robot-contextualized\nrepresentations p(r′\ni |r1, .. .,rN ) that are predictive of next action (i.e., “how robots influence each\nother’ s motion”). Cross-attention allows robot tokens to attend to the floor context around them\nto produce floor-contextualized representations p(r′\ni |x1, .. .,xM ) that are predictive of next action\n(i.e., “how the structure of the floor environment conditions next action probabilities”). The use\nof cross-attention allows very large contextual attention independent of the decoded sequence\nlength [46].\nGiven a historical window of snapshots Rt−K :t ,Xt−K :t we have the option to explore two orthogo-\nnal attention axes: along the robot index or along the time index. Attention along the robot index\ninterprets the input as a sequence of all N robots at a single time step t. The input sequence is\nthen self-attended among all robots and decoding of all N actions for the next time step happens\nin parallel. On the other hand, attention along the time index interprets the input as a sequence\nof K time steps for a single robot. The input sequence is then causally self-attended among all\nprevious states and decoding the next action happens serially. For this work, we implemented\nthe latter time-indexed method, which we call a decoder-only variant.\nDecoder-only (per-robot temporal modeling).

This dense, image-level strategy complements the sparse view of\nthe RC model and the tokenized views of the RF and GF models by enabling direct pixel-wise\nreasoning over topology, traffic density, and local congestion patterns that emerge only when\nthe floor is viewed as a whole. Because every robot is updated simultaneously, the model can\nexploit GPU-friendly batched convolutions and achieve constant latency—independent of fleet\nsize—during both training and inference.\nAt each time step the floor is rasterized into an H ×W ×C tensor, where (H,W ) matches the floor\nsize and C denotes feature channels. Static channels encode immutable topology information,\nwhile dynamic channels encode per-robot quantities such as occupancy and robot state. Each\ngrid cell can host up to two robots; when this occurs, their features are concatenated along\nthe channel dimension and the excess left blank. To keep the channel count moderate we\npartition features into semantic blocks (topology, kinematics, mission cues) and normalize\neach block separately, yielding well-behaved statistics across sites of different sizes and traffic\npatterns. Finally, a learned positional embedding map P ∈ RH×W ×de is added to every feature\nstack, injecting absolute floor coordinates so that the convolutional encoder can distinguish\nvisually similar but physically distant cells.\n7.1.

Spatial Encoder. A stack of convolutional blocks with residual skip paths downsamples the\ninput image by powers of two, producing a latent map zt ∈ R\nH\n8 ×W\n8 ×d that summarizes local\ncontext within an 8 ×8 window. Group normalization and SiLU activations stabilize training,\nwhile a 1 ×1 projection aligns channel depth with the transformer’ s hidden size.\n2. Temporal Transformer.For a history window (zt−K ,. .. ,zt ) we flatten each latent map into a\nsequence of Npatch tokens and feed the resulting (K +1) ×Npatch token stream into a decoder-\nonly transformer with causal masking. Multi-head self-attention thus mixes information both\nacross time and across spatial patches, capturing complex interactions such as congested\ncrossroads or queue spill-back. Rotary positional embeddings preserve temporal order without\nadding quadratic cost.\n3. Spatial Decoder. The transformer’ s output tokens are reshaped back to a latent map˜zt+1, then\nupsampled through a mirrored convolutional decoder with skip connections from matching\nencoder stages. These lateral shortcuts re-inject fine-scale geometry that may be lost in the\nbottleneck, improving localization of narrow aisles and corner cells.\n4. Per-Cell Heads. Two light MLP heads are applied per pixel: a regression head outputs∆x,∆y\n(Manhattan distance) for motion, and a classification head predicts laden flag & orientation\nclass. A gated fusion module allows the heads to share low-level features while learning\ntask-specific cues.\n7.2. Training Objective\nAt its core, the IF model solves a multi-task learning problem: it must (i) regress continuous\nmotion offsets for every active robot cell, and (ii) classify discrete state attributes (load status and\nheading) for those same cells. We therefore adopt a composite loss that couples a mean-squared-\nerror term (for kinematics) with a focal cross-entropy term (for categorical state), allowing the\nnetwork to share early features while giving each task a dedicated error signal. Formally, LetS\nbe the set of grid cells that contain at least one robot in the ground-truth target frame. For each\nsuch cell p ∈ S we denote the true motion vector by mp = (∆x,∆y) and the model’ s prediction\nby ˆmp . Similarly, yc\np and ˆyc\np are the one-hot target and post-softmax probabilities for categorical\nclass c ∈{load, heading}. The joint loss is\nLIF = λreg\n1\n|S |\nX\np∈S\n°° ˆmp −mp\n°°2\n2 + λcls\nX\nc∈{load,heading}\nFL\n¡\nˆyc ,yc ¢\n, (7)\nwhere FL(·) is the focal loss FL(pt ) = αt (1 − pt )γ log pt with (αt ,γ) = (0.25,2). The first term is\na per-cell MSE that drives accurate regression of ∆x and ∆y displacements; the second term\ndown-weights easy negatives so the classifier focuses on rarer events such as rotations or load\ntransitions. Sampling only the active set S prevents static background pixels from overwhelming\nthe motion loss, while still letting the decoder see full images during the forward pass.\nBy synthesizing spatially dense encodings with sequence-level attention, the IF model offers a\nGPU-efficient framework for whole-floor forecasting. It captures congestion waves, lane-level\ninteractions, and topology-conditioned motion patterns that are difficult to express in token-\nbased models.\n16"}

This spatial representation is extended into the temporal domain by constructing a\nspatiotemporal graph GT = (VT ,ET ) that models the warehouse dynamics over time. The spa-\ntiotemporal node set VT =V ×{1, ...,T } represents each vertex in G at a discrete timestep, where a\nnode (vi , t) captures both the static attributes of vertexvi and the dynamic attributes of any robot\noccupying that vertex at time t (using a zero vector when unoccupied). The spatiotemporal edge\nset ET is partitioned into two components: the spatial edges, Espatial = {((vi , t),(v j , t)) | (vi , v j ) ∈\nE , t ∈ {1,..., T }} which preserve the spatial connectivity structure at each timestep; and the tempo-\nral edges, Etemporal = {((vi , t),(vi , t +1)) | vi ∈V, t ∈ {1, ...,T −1}} which connect each vertex to itself\nat adjacent timesteps, enabling the model to capture temporal dependencies.

A graph encoder embeds nodes and edges;\nmessage-passing plus edge-aware self-attention propagate context over arbitrary distances; and\na multi-task decoder jointly outputs move/rotate actions, heading angles, and laden state for all\nthe robots. Together with the local RC and snapshot-based RF baselines, the GF model frames a\ncomprehensive set of inductive biases for studying large-scale multi-robot prediction.\n8.3. Inference Roll-out\nDuring inference, the GF model predicts future states in an autoregressive loop. At each time step\nτ we perform three steps:\n1. Forward pass. Feed the current spatiotemporal graph slice Sτ through the network Fθ to\nobtain, for every robot node, the robot movement action ˆaτ, the target heading ˆθτ, and the\nload status ˆℓτ.\n2. State transition. Apply the deterministic floor dynamics ffloor :( ˆaτ, ˆθτ, ˆℓτ) 7→ Sτ+1: robots that\nmove update their vertex, pose, and load status; robots that wait simply copy their previous\nstate.\n3. Collision arbitration. If two robots claim the same destination vertex, the request that has\nhigher confidence is honored and the second robot is rolled back to its prior pose (mirroring\nthe first-come-first-serve rule used in the RC model).\nBecause the processor caches key-value memories from the preceding step, each prediction\nstep costs O(|V |+| E|), which is linear in the warehouse size. This loop is repeated until the\ndesired forecast horizon is reached, yielding a consistent, step-by-step simulation of future fleet\nbehavior.\n9. Conclusions\nWe presented DEEP FLEET , a collection of four distinct architectures for neural networks that\nare pre-trained to predict large-scale mobile robot fleet movement. The four models cover\nthe design space for multi-robot foundation models, spanning across different types of priors,\nrepresentations of static and dynamic features, and neural families. We trained the models on\nmillions of robot hours of production data from Amazon warehouses, and evaluated them on\ntheir ability to predict future states autoregressively.\nOur empirical analysis revealed key learnings for the design of multi-agent foundation models.\nFirst, we learned that next action prediction outperforms floor state prediction: both the RC\nmodel, which predicts the next actions of robots based on their state and that of their immediate\nenvironment, and the RF model, which also explicitly cross-attends floor and robot features,\noutperformed our floor-based models. We also learned that using convolutional encoding over\nan image-like representation of the floor and robots performs poorly, even at comparable model\nsizes. We suspect this representation does not provide adequate inductive bias to model robot\n20"}

Foundation models pretrained on\nlarge-scale medical event data represent a promising direction for scaling real-world evidence generation\nand generalizing to diverse downstream tasks. Using Epic Cosmos, a dataset with medical events from\nde-identified longitudinal health records for 16.3 billion encounters over 300 million unique patient records\nfrom 310 health systems, we introduce the Cosmos Medical Event Transformer (CoMET) models, a family\nof decoder-only transformer models pretrained on 118 million patients representing 115 billion discrete\nmedical events (151 billion tokens). We present the largest scaling-law study for medical event data,\nestablishing a methodology for pretraining and revealing power-law scaling relationships for compute,\ntokens, and model size. Based on this, we pretrained a series of compute-optimal models with up to 1\nbillion parameters. Conditioned on a patient’s real-world history,CoMET autoregressively generates\nthe next medical event, simulating patient health timelines. We studied 78 real-world tasks, including\ndiagnosis prediction, disease prognosis, and healthcare operations. Remarkably for a foundation model\nwith generic pretraining and simulation-based inference,CoMET generally outperformed or matched\ntask-specific supervised models on these tasks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or few-shot\nexamples. CoMET’s predictive power consistently improves as the model and pretraining scale. Our\nresults show thatCoMET, a generative medical event foundation model, can effectively capture complex\nclinical dynamics, providing an extensible and generalizable framework to support clinical decision-making,\nstreamline healthcare operations, and improve patient outcomes.\n1 Introduction\nSafe and effective medical care aims to deliver the right intervention to the right patient at the right time. In\npursuit of this goal, patients, clinicians, and health system leaders seek consensus-driven guidelines, integrated\ndata sources, and richer information that captures the full diversity of real-world healthcare. Optimal health\noutcomes require care that excels across, at minimum, four pillars: accurate diagnosis, reliable prognosis,\nindividualized treatment planning, and optimized clinical workflow [1]. Succeeding across each of these pillars\nrequires understanding a patient’s longitudinal medical history, addressing diagnostic and future uncertainty,\nincorporating patient values and goals, and adapting reasoning to temporal and clinical contexts.\nReal-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE) offer a scalable path to personalized medical\ncare. RWD-driven insights already inform post-market safety surveillance, regulatory approvals, and guide\n∗Co-first authors\n†Corresponding author: rahul@epic.com\n1\narXiv:2508.12104v1  [cs.LG]  16 Aug 2025"}

Today, usingRWD to generate RWE at scale\ndemands significant analytic expertise and manual curation, constraining its day-to-day impact at the point\nof care [2, 4]. Unlocking its full potential will require methods that can transform raw data into actionable\ninsights at the point of care in a scalable, generalizable, and personalized way.\nEpic Cosmos1 was created to address these challenges. A collaboration among health systems using Epic\nthat is governed by a peer-elected council of participants, Cosmos aggregates de-identified longitudinal health\nrecords for more than 300 million patients and 16.3 billion encounters as of August 2025, de-duplicating\neach patient’s records across health systems and combining them into a single, integrated longitudinal\nrecord. This platform unifies common clinical data—including laboratory results, diagnoses, medications,\nand procedures—and includes other data relevant to health, such as social drivers of health, cancer staging,\ngenomic variants, and patient-reported outcomes, among many other data types. The de-identified data in\nCosmos is intended to support patient care and accelerate scientific discovery. Insights from Cosmos are\ndelivered to clinicians today at the point of care through features in Epic like the Cosmos Median Length of\nStay, Look-Alikes, and Best Care Choices for My Patient™. Cosmos data and its downstream applications\nare only made available to health systems that contribute data to it. Cosmos has also been used to address a\nwide variety of research priorities [6] such as understanding large trends in healthcare [7, 8], investigating\nrare diseases [9, 10], and analyzing healthcare utilization [11, 12].\nYet even at the scale of Cosmos, answering a single clinical question requires crafting custom cohort\ndefinitions, feature-engineering pipelines, and statistical analyses. To enable personalized medicine and\nRWEat scale for routine clinical decision-making, we need tools that can learn from the integrated patient\nrecord and can answer complex medical inquiries with flexibility, retrieving the rightRWEto support clinical\ndecision-making across a wide variety of contexts.\nFoundation models pretrained on real-world patient journeys have shown promise in addressing this\nproblem, where a patient journey is formulated as a sequence of medical events. By learning latent\nrepresentations of complete patient records, generative medical event models can provide patient-specific\npredictions via simulated health timelines. By simulating multiple probabilistic timelines of a patient’s health,\nquantitative predictions can be made about the likelihood of events over specific time intervals. A single set\nof generated trajectories can flexibly address a wide range of clinical queries even without pre-specifying tasks,\nbuilding task-specific models, or prompting a natural language model with tailored questions. Furthermore,\nbecause medical foundation models are trained specifically on medical event tokens, they can be more\nparameter and token-efficient in their representations. Generative medical event foundation models also offer\nextensive flexibility for forecasting future events, beyond just binary or quantitative prediction tasks; for\nexample, they can predict the most likely order of events or generate a set of all events within a time frame\nfrom among hundreds of thousands of possibilities. Medical foundation models also provide a unique form\nof interpretability, in that clinicians and researchers can study individual generated trajectories of medical\nevents to better validate and understand the sequence of events which the model predicts may lead up to\ndownstream outcomes.\nPrevious models, such as CLMBR [13], MOTOR [14], Foresight [15], ETHOS [16], and others (see\nSection 4.3) have illustrated the feasibility of this approach; however, their scopes are constrained by dataset"}

Moreover, the choices of\nmodel size and compute have not been systematically studied and it’s unclear whether they are optimal and\nhow they should scale with available data. This is particularly challenging forRWEstudies at the population\nscale of Cosmos, as suboptimal model size and compute can be extremely costly and wasteful.\nTo the best of our knowledge, Zhang et al.[17] conducted the first comprehensive study of the scaling\nlaws on structured patient records. They observed power-law relationships among compute, model size,\nand pretraining data similar to the text domain, albeit with much higher token-to-parameter ratio, which\nmight be attributable to the distinct characteristics of medical events. In this paper, we apply this same\nmethodology to pretraining on Cosmos data, producing to date the largest scaling-law study on real-world\npatient journeys. The study in Zhang et al.[17] was limited to a de-identified dataset with only 70 thousand\npatients in emergency medicine. By contrast, our study is not only more than three orders of magnitude\nlarger in terms of the number of patients, but also covers an extremely diverse range of patient populations\nand health conditions.\n1https://cosmos.epic.com\n2"}

We transformed each patient’s medical events into a chronological sequence, where events\nare each represented by compact tokens. Certain tokenization methods were inspired by ETHOS [16]\nand adapted for the scale and heterogeneity of Cosmos data. Section 5 provides additional information\non pre-processing, sequencing, and tokenization of Cosmos data. We trainedCoMET using the Qwen2\ntransformer architecture [18] with random initialization—i.e., without loading any pretrained Qwen2 weights\n(see Section 5.3 for training details).

We measured CoMET’s ability to generate valid individual\nmedical events that span multiple tokens, including diagnosis codes, medication codes, lab-result events, and\ndepartment specialties in all encounter headers (see Appendix C and Table 6). Generated multi-token events\nwere rarely invalid, and the error rate decreased as model scale increased. Furthermore, the prevalence of\nindividual medical events for diagnoses, medications, labs, and procedures within one year as generated by\nCoMET all strongly agreed with their corresponding prevalence in the same patients’ 1-year future, as did\nthe 1-year co-occurrence rate of pairs of medical events (see Appendix D and Table 6).\n2.2.2 Encounter types and frequency\nIn addition to individual medical events, we measured how well CoMET probabilistically generates the\nnumber and types of medical encounters a given patient will experience within one year. Using the same\nmodel generations as Section 2.2.1, we found each patient’s probability distribution for the number of office\nvisits, emergency visits, and hospital admissions that would occur in the next year.

We selected two clusters of diagnoses, hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) diseases and rheumatic diseases,\nbecause they span a variety of clinical presentations, can take multiple encounters to diagnose definitively,\nand have challenges with delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis [23–30]. Diseases within each cluster often present\nclinically with overlapping signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings, and as a result they often appear\ntogether on differential diagnoses. We selected nine diagnoses for bothHPB and rheumatic diseases, and\nfor each we selected a cohort of patients who received that diagnosis (see Section 5.6.6 for diagnoses and\ntheir code-based definitions, and Table 20 for sample sizes). For each patient, we chose several points in their\nhistory in the one-year span before the first occurrence of their target diagnosis and hadCoMET predict their\nrisk for all the cluster’s diagnoses. In this way,CoMET produced a ranked, quantitative differential diagnosis\nat multiple time points for each patient and flagged patients at risk of receiving these diagnoses. We did not\nprompt CoMET with any information beyond the start of the encounter at which the patient first received\ntheir target diagnosis, so CoMET never sees any diagnostic workup or documentation from this encounter.\nEach plot in the top row of Figure 10 and Figure 11 shows how many patients were flagged by CoMET-L\nas having at least 10% risk for the target diagnosis (bold) and each of the off-target diagnoses within the\ncluster (lighter, thinner lines).

In contrast,AUCROC metrics fromCoMET generally\nincrease over time and as model size increases. This suggests thatCoMET models can effectively distinguish\npatients with similar presentations but different eventual diagnoses, and they can produce realistic differential\ndiagnoses that become more sensitive and specific as the patient’s clinical presentation and diagnostic workup\nevolve. AUCROC at the final prediction time is reported for all diagnoses and models in Table 11. Of note,\nthese analyses do not address whether early diagnosis flagging reflects the diagnostic workup being pursued\nby the patient’s medical providersversus the ability to preemptively flag diagnoses before significant clinical\nsuspicion.\nFigure 10 shows that, among all nineHPB diseases, the correct diagnosis was the one most commonly\nflagged byCoMET-L, with the gap between the first- and second-ranked diagnoses generally increasing with\ntime. For acute pancreatitis,AUCROC is hardly better than chance until the target diagnosis date. For\ndiseases with generally more insidious onset (e.g., cancer, chronic viral hepatitis, and alcoholic liver disease),\nCoMET-L was able to flag many patients much earlier (Figure 10).\nFor rheumatic disorders (Figure 11), most patients were flagged at the 10% risk levels for osteoarthritis at\nsome point, regardless of their eventual diagnosis. This is likely both because osteoarthritis is a common\ndiagnosis for patients with undifferentiated joint pain and because of early inaccurate or imprecise diagnosis\nand documentation. Among the remaining eight target diagnoses, the correct diagnosis was ranked second for\nfive cohorts, third for two, and fourth for one.AUCROC scores forCoMET models ranged from 0.66-0.79\nacross rheumatic diagnoses at the final prediction time (Table 11).\n2.5 CoMET models forecast patients’ interactions with the health system\nReliably forecasting health system interactions enables clinicians and health systems to plan for the needs of\ntheir patients. We assessedCoMET’s generated patient timelines for their ability to make accurate predictions\nabout a patient’s interactions with the healthcare system.\nHaving earlier assessed the probability calibration of predicting the number of encounters over a year in\nFigure 3, we next asked how close these predictions were to the ground truth number of encounters. For\ninpatient, outpatient, and emergency encounters, all threeCoMET models demonstrated lower mean absolute\nerror (MAE) than supervised task-specific regression models for predicting future encounter counts. Results\nare shown in Figure 12.\n2.5.1 Hospital length of stay and 30-day readmission\nAccurate hospital length of stay (LOS) prediction helps health systems manage beds and plan patient\ncare to limit discharge delays [31]. We evaluated CoMET’s ability to predictLOS on 10,000 randomly\nselected hospital admissions (see Table 21 for evaluation set statistics). All models received the patient’s\nhistory through the admission encounter’s header (i.e., encounter type, department specialty, and any chief\ncomplaints), in addition to the documented primary diagnosis.\nAnother metric for assessing healthcare utilization is the 30-day hospital readmission risk, an important\nand well-studied operational consideration for care transitions, discharge planning, and outpatient follow-\nup [32]. We randomly selected 10,000 patients being discharged from the hospital and had models predict the\nprobability that a new hospitalization would occur within 30 days (patients who in real life were readmitted\nwithin a day were excluded from this analysis because they may often reflect hospital transfers or clerically\nerroneous discharges [33]).

This step was important not only for understanding the\nbest parameters for training models, but also to understand how to optimally scale medical event foundation\nmodels on a sufficiently large dataset. Building on recent work demonstrating power-law scaling for generative\nmedical event prediction on the MIMIC-IV dataset [17], we applied the same approach to Cosmos by training\na sweep of 10 model sizes ranging from two million to one billion parameters on our dataset of over 136 billion\ntraining tokens.\nAs in Hoffmann et al.[34], we ran a grid search over varying amounts of trainingTFLOPs to find the\noptimal scaling of model size and training tokens for theCoMET medical event dataset. After performing\nsmaller training runs at four fixed compute budgets, we fit parabolas to the isoFLOP curves (Figure 15).\n107 108 109\nNum Params\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nValidation loss\nFLOPs\n 1e18\n 3e18\n 6e18\n 1e19\n1018 1019\nCompute (FLOPs)\n6M\n10M\n20M\n30M\nNum Params\nα = 0.520\n1018 1019\nCompute (FLOPs)\n10B\n20B\n30B\n40B\n Total Tokens\nβ = 0.512\nFigure 15: Optimal training of CoMET models follows power laws.The minimum loss achieved by training\nruns with fixed compute and varied number of model parameters(left).

The incident disease evaluations are particularly sensitive ton, possibly due\nto most patients having a low probability of having these events. Similar to language models [36], increasing\ntrain and test-time compute provide orthogonal directions to improve performance on downstream tasks.\n3 Discussion\n3.1 Key findings\nHere we demonstrate that large-scale, medical event foundation models can learn from longitudinal patient\nrecords to produce realistic and useful clinical predictions. Trained on a subset of the 16.3B encounters across\n300M patient records as of August 2025 from Cosmos,CoMET is a family of decoder-only transformer models\nup to 1B parameters in size that probabilistically generate medical event sequences which not only preserve\nevent- and encounter-level realism but also demonstrate a broad range of short- and long-term predictive\ncapabilities.\nPrevious medical event foundation models have been constrained by training on smaller datasets or a\nlimited number of data types [37]. CoMET models were trained directly on sequences of structured medical\nevents spanning core clinical data types (i.e., demographics, encounters, diagnoses, chief complaints, labs,\nmedications, procedures, and time). Rather than relying on natural language inputs and outputs,CoMET\ndirectly receives discrete medical events from a patient’s medical record as input, learning event-level structure,\nlong-range temporal dependencies, and the underlying probability distribution of medical events. As of this\nwriting, CoMET represents the largest medical-event foundation model by number of medical events used for\ntraining.\nEvaluation of medical event foundation models has typically been performed on relatively few evaluation\ntasks [37]. By assessingCoMET’s performance across a broad and diverse suite of clinical tasks spanning\nsingle-encounter generation, disease-specific outcome prediction, acute-on-chronic risk estimation, incident\ndisease detection, differential diagnosis, and operational forecasting, we explored its potential as a flexible and\ngeneralizable tool for a range of clinical contexts.CoMET-L, our largest model, matched or outperformed\n17"}

Performance gains were evident across multiple clinical\ndomains, supporting CoMET’s generalizability and utility for diverse downstream applications.\nWe also conducted the largest scaling law analysis for medical event data to date—more than300×\nlarger than the largest previous work [17]. To investigate medical event scaling laws, we employ the same\nmethodology from [34], exploring isoFLOPs across four fixed compute points. Our isoFLOPs analysis yields\nsimilar exponents to those shown in the natural language (NL) domain (α= 0.520 and β = 0.512), suggesting\nwe should scale training tokens and model parameters proportionally to train compute-optimal models [34].\nIn contrast to work in the NL domain, we observe an optimal token-to-parameter ratio of 1,000:1, closely\nmatching results from prior work on medical event scaling laws [17].\nLastly, we found that loss minimization predictably translates into better downstream performance on\nour suite of evaluations. Nearly every clinical task we evaluated exhibited sigmoidal improvements in their\nperformance metrics as we minimized training loss. These trends were consistent across task families and\nclinical domains, and most tasks had not yet plateaued, indicating substantial remaining headroom. This\nresult highlights pretraining loss as a useful proxy for downstream capability, and suggests that continuing to\nscale will yield better downstream utility. In addition to training-time scaling, we also observe benefits from\nincreased inference-time compute: generating more patient simulations per prediction consistently improves\ndownstream performance metrics across many clinical tasks.\n3.2 Limitations\nEven with these strengths, CoMET has clear limitations.\nReal-world data. CoMET is trained on real-world healthcare data in Cosmos, and it is subject to\nimprecision and errors in documentation and clinical practice [38]. Several automated data quality control\nprocesses in Cosmos aim to improve data completeness and identify irregularities, and these periodic analyses\nare fed back to the contributing organizations [6]. Cosmos aggregates data across 310 health systems with\nextensive linking and deduplication efforts, but individuals may receive care at other health systems that is\nnot recorded in Cosmos. This leads to data gaps before, within, and after observed medical event sequences.\nCertain prediction targets may be missing or occur earlier than the first record in Cosmos. We mitigate this\nby training and evaluating on patients who meet predefined criteria for observable healthcare utilization (see\nSection 5.1) and by the use of time tokens, which allow the model to read and generate patterns of absent\ndata.\nTokenization. While the tokenizer for CoMET can be used to encode a wide range of clinical data, the\ndiscretization of continuous values like laboratory results and time masks smaller changes in these values\nthat may be important for some prediction tasks. Future work can investigate tradeoffs in performance and\nmodel complexity between a pure categorical approach and a hybrid approach that handles numeric values\nseparately [39–43]. In addition, we did not conduct an evaluation for training a tokenizer or optimizing\nvocabulary size, presenting a rich avenue for future work. Tokenizers trade vocabulary size for sequence\nlength which can impact performance in non-trivial ways with model scale [44]. As shown in Figure 18,\nmany patients’ entire tokenized history exceeded the model’s current context window of 8,192, presenting an\nopportunity to improve performance with longer context models. Finally, while CoMET tokenized and was\ntrained on a core set of structured clinical data types Section 5.2, many other data types remain to be added.\nEvaluation.

This is not\nintended as an exhaustive survey of all related literature; rather, we summarize representative work that\ncaptures the state of the art, key challenges, and motivations for our approach.\n4.1 Epic Cosmos\nAs described above, Cosmos is a collaboration for integrating and linking electronic health record (EHR)\ndata between 310 healthcare organizations2 in the United States, Canada, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia as\nof August 2025 [6]. The Cosmos population from healthcare organizations in the United States is largely\nrepresentative of census data. While some variation from national statistics has been noted, Cosmos has\nbeen shown to accurately reflect information and trends in other national databases (e.g. transplant registry,\ncomorbidity patterns) [45, 46].

These studies highlight challenges and opportunities. Varghese\net al.[50] used Cosmos to demonstrate that the type of subtle differencesCoMET captures impact risk of\nacute events among patients withT2DM. Patel et al.[51] demonstrated that Cosmos rates of systemic lupus\nerythematosus (SLE) based on structured data in diagnosis codes were lower than expected, and paradoxical\nmortality findings in [52] highlight the challenges of working withEHR data. Relatedly, Cosmos has been\nused for developing and validating risk scores and strata in other conditions, including cancer-associated\nthrombosis [53], vision impairment in multiple sclerosis [54], and perinatal cardiovascular events among\npatients with rare congenital diseases [55]. Several Cosmos publications have studied healthcare utilization\noutcomes in distinct subpopulations [56–58]. Section 2.6 demonstrates how forecasting these types of metrics\ncan be scaled withCoMET. While the present evaluation did not include the detailed phenotype modeling\nand validation included in some of these studies, CoMET data can readily be analyzed and fine tuned with\ngreater specificity and logical complexity employed in other Cosmos studies. In this way, CoMET may inform\nand be informed by more traditional Cosmos research.\n4.2 Scaling laws for LLMs\nResearch into the scaling behavior of machine learning models has fundamentally shaped the trajectory of\nlarge language models (LLMs). A pivotal study by Kaplan et al.[35] showed that as we increase a model’s\nsize, the amount of training data, and the compute budget, the performance improves following a smooth\npower-law trend—a predictable pattern that governs how model performance grows with more resources.\nHenighan et al.[59] extended this analysis beyond text to other domains like images, video, and multi-modal\ntasks, finding that larger transformer models consistently yield better predictive power across modalities as\ncompute and model size grow, again following power-law improvement curves. A further demonstration of\nscale came from Brown et al.[60], who presented 175B parameter GPT-3 and found that simply making the\nmodel extremely large unlocked emergent capabilities; notably the ability to perform new tasks in a few-shot\nsetting without any task-specific training. Subsequently, Hoffmann et al.[34] observed that many earlier\nlarge models were trained with too little data. They trained a 70B Chinchilla with four times more data than\nGPT-3, using the same compute budget, and found it outperformed much larger models. The frontier of scale\nwas later pushed further by Chowdhery et al.[61] and OpenAI[62, 63], where the performance continued to\nimprove log-linearly with scale. Studies ofLLM scaling laws provide a guiding principle for our work, which\nasks whether similar predictable gains occur when we scale up models on more patient data.\n4.3 Medical foundation models\nInspired by the success of foundation models in general domains, researchers have started developing large-\nscale models tailored to electronic health records. BEHRT [64] introduced a BERT-like transformer model\ntrained on the longitudinal medical histories of 1.6 million patients. This approach yielded substantial\nimprovements for disease prediction compared to prior state-of-the-art models. Med-BERT [65] was developed\nfrom 28 million patients, which further validated the power of large-scale pretraining on structuredEHR\ndata. CLMBR [13] introduced an autoregressive next-code predictor trained on 3.4 million patient records;\nthe representations it learned boosted AUCROC across multiple downstream tasks, especially in low-data\nsettings. MOTOR [14] trained a transformer-based model for time-to-event (TTE) prediction using 55 million\npatient records, demonstrating the transfer learning ability for the TTE foundation model.\nMoving beyond encoder-only models like BERT, recent research has explored generative and autoregressive"}

They investigated how model\nperformance scales with size and data volume on smaller scales using MIMIC-IV [70], identifying consistent\npatterns such as power-law relationships between compute resources, model parameters, and clinical utility.\n5 Methods\n5.1 Data Pre-Processing\nTo ensure that Cosmos supplies the foundation model with records of sufficient depth and quality, we apply a\nthree-stage filter before tokenization.\n1. Patient selection. We retain only adults who have meaningful longitudinal follow-up within Cosmos:\n• Age between 18 and 120 years on January 1, 2012.\n• At least two successive face-to-face encounters within a two-year period between January 1, 2012 and\nApril 17, 2025.\nThe encounter-frequency requirement screens out patients whose primary care occurs outside Cosmos-\ncontributing sites, while the 2012 index date avoids the sparse documentation that characterizes earlier\nyears and simplifies downstream temporal alignment. We exclude pediatric patients because of significantly\ndifferent care patterns (e.g., routine well-child visits, growth-chart measurements, age-specific dosing).\n2. Encounter selection. From the eligible patients we include encounters based on these criteria:\n• Encounter belongs to an eligible patient.\n• The encounter start date on or after January 1, 2012 and before April 17, 2025.\n• Encounter type is associated with direct clinical care (e.g., outpatient visit, emergency-department stay,\ninpatient admission, telehealth, and many others). We discard canceled appointments, test records, and\nadministrative placeholders that rarely carry coded clinical data.\nEncounter types span core clinical areas such as office visits (17.1%), emergency (2.1%), surgery (1.0%),\nand inpatient (0.76%), but also include a broad range of other encounter types from telemedicine (0.88%)\nand home care (1.0%) to anesthesia (0.97%) and prenatal visits (0.39%).\n3. Post-filter cleanup. Patients left with zero qualifying encounters after the above steps are removed to\nprevent empty timelines. This results in 118M unique patient records in our full dataset.\n21"}

Train/Test Split. 90% of the patients were randomly allocated for training, with the remaining 10%\nreserved for all evaluations. Experiments using temporal train/test splits to assess generalization across time\nare an important consideration for future work.\nThis pipeline yields a cohort whose records are dense enough to train a sequence model while minimizing noise\nfrom sporadic documentation and non-clinical artifacts. We applied very minimal filtering of patient records\nor input data to reflect the diversity of patients and the realities of real world healthcare documentation. For\na full breakdown of our dataset, see Table 4.\n5.2 Tokenization Details\nOur tokenization method adapts a few key techniques from Renc et al.[16]. In general, medical events are\nplaced in chronological order according to the instant at which they were documented, with some type-specific\nnuances noted below. The token vocabulary is defineda priori based on the individual events that are\npossible rather than frequency-based methods like byte-pair encoding. When possible we tokenized using\nontologies with codes that directly capture hierarchical and categorical information, such asICD-10-CM and\nAnatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC). All CoMET models have a vocabulary size of 7,105, which is\nsummarized in Table 2.\nEvent Type Tokens/event Number of Unique Tokens\nSex 1 6\nRace 1 7\nAge and Years since 1970 1 24\nBeginning of Sequence 1 1\nEncounter Starts & Ends 1 226 (113 types)\nDepartment Specialties 1 299\nChief Complaint (Name) 1 1231\nChief Complaint (Body Location) 1 67\nDiagnoses 1-3 2429\nLab Results 1 1000\nLab Quantiles 1 10\nMedication Orders 1-3 289\nProcedures 1 1500\nTime ≥ 1 13\nTable 2: Medical events included in CoMET’s vocabulary. The tokenizer also includes separation, padding, and\nunknown tokens.\n5.2.1 Demographics\nPatient history sequences begin with a set of demographics tokens, which represent patient attributes that\nare not tied to a single encounter. We included demographics tokens for sex, race, and age at first encounter,\nalong with the number of years from 1970 to the start of the patient’s medical history (both in 5-year buckets).\nAdditionally, we added a “Beginning of Sequence” token to denote the start of the patient timeline after\nthe demographics section. Sex is bucketed into “Male”, “Female”, “Unknown”, “Masked”, “Other”, and\n“Unspecified”.\n5.2.2 Encounters\nEncounters are book-ended with start- and end-encounter tokens—each with a denoted encounter type (e.g.,\n“Emergency_Start”, “Emergency_End”). Each encounter header contains the start token, a department\nspecialty token, and possible chief complaint tokens. Chief complaints in Cosmos consist of a name and an\noptional body location, which we separated into two unique consecutive tokens per chief complaint. When\n22"}

In general, we do not enforce rules for overlapping or nested encounter-start or -end\ntokens; their placement in the patient sequence corresponds only to the time at which the event happened,\nwith the tokens for a given encounter header always appearing consecutively.\n5.2.3 Diagnoses\nDiagnosis events are represented by the associatedICD-10-CM code. ICD-10-CM codes were split up into\nthree tokens by category and sub-category (first 3 characters), specific details (characters 4-5), and additional\ndetails and extensions (characters 6-7). Diagnoses are represented in CoMET patient trajectories by 1-3\ntokens depending on the specificity of the documentation in the patient’s chart. Because diagnosis events\nin Cosmos only have documentation resolution at the day level, they are placed at the very beginning of\nthe encounter after the encounter header or at midnight of their documented date, whichever comes later.\nDiagnoses with the same date are sequenced in random order.\n5.2.4 Labs\nOur dataset contains the 1,000 most common numeric lab tests from Cosmos (representing >99% of all\nnumeric lab test results). Each lab result is represented by two consecutive tokens which identify the test\nperformed and the quantile of the numeric result, following ETHOS [16]. Lab components are represented by\nLogical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC®)3 codes, and numeric results are stratified by\nLOINC and measurement unit. For each LOINC-unit pair we partitioned values into 10 equal-frequency bins\nand mapped them to generic tokens. Compared to uniform-width binning, quantiles better accommodate\nnon-linear mappings between heterogeneous units and better balance token frequencies, though they can\ncompress rare but clinically meaningful extremes. The lab-result token pairs are placed in the sequence at\nthe instance of collection. This ensures the sequence mirrors the patient’s evolving clinical state but calls for\ncareful consideration to ensure that only information available at the evaluation time is used.\n5.2.5 Medications\nMedication orders are represented by anATCcode without other data.ATCcodes were split up into three\nsets of tokens by anatomical group and therapeutic subgroup (characters 1-3), pharmacological and chemical\nsubgroup (characters 4-5), and chemical substance (characters 6-7). Medication orders are represented in\nCoMET patient trajectories using three consecutive tokens to represent the fullATC code. They are placed\nin the sequence at the instant of the order.\n5.2.6 Procedures\nWe extracted all billed procedures with Current Procedure Terminology (CPT®)4 codes in Cosmos into our\ndataset. Our codes include such events as conventional procedures and imaging tests, as well as CPT codes\nassociated with other billed codes like lab panel orders and level of service. We only tokenized the 1,500\nmost common procedures in our dataset to avoid sparse procedure tokens in our vocabulary (this represented\n97.3% of all procedure events). They are placed in the sequence at procedure start instant.\n5.2.7 Time\nThe passage of time was represented in the medical event sequence by one or more tokens that represent a\ntime interval. The token is selected from a set of time ranges following Renc et al.[16], ranging from “1-5\nminutes” to “3-6 months”. Events that occur within a shorter time span than the smallest time range are not\nseparated using any time tokens. Events that occur more than 6 months apart have one or more “6 month”\ntokens, rounded to the nearest integer.\n3LOINC® is a registered trademark of Regenstrief Institute, Inc.\n4CPT® is a registered trademark of the American Medical Association.\n23"}

Qwen2 incorporates pre-layer normalization, SwiGLU\nactivations, rotary positional embeddings, and grouped-query attention, all of which improve training time\nand stability. CoMET models were trained with cross-entropy loss and standard hyperparameters, slightly\nadjusting them as determined by experimentation to account for possible differences in training transformers\non medical events rather than natural language. Batch size was fixed at 512 sequences, and input sequences\nwere densely packed in order to fully use the context window during training, with only a separation token\nmarking different patients since our experiments demonstrated this was sufficient for training. Following\nHoffmann et al.[34], we employed a 10x learning rate decay with cosine schedule and used AdamW as our\noptimizer.\nWe estimated the computeC used in training a model by the number ofTFLOPs required in the forward\nand backward passes, using PaLM’s methodology [61], whereN is the number of parameters in the model and\nD is the number of training tokens used. To obtain our power-law fit for optimal parameter countNopt and\nnumber of tokensDopt for a fixedC, we fixedC and variedN and D to obtain a set of isoFLOP experiments\n(Figure 15[A]). Each isoFLOP’s loss-versus-log N and loss-versus-log D points were fit to parabolas, and the\nminimum point of the parabola served asNopt and Dopt for that value ofC. We then plottedlog Nopt vs.\nlog C (Figure 15[B]) andlog Dopt vs. log C (Figure 15[C]) and fit a power law, using the first-degreeα and β\nterms, respectively, to measure the relative power-law scaling of optimal model size versus optimal training\ntokens.\n5.4 Benchmarking with Task-Specific Supervised Models\nTo contextualize the performance ofCoMET, we implemented three baseline approaches representing distinct\nmodeling paradigms. These included (1) linear and logistic regression models, representing classical linear\napproaches; (2) gradient-boosted decision trees, a strong non-linear method widely used for structured data;\nand (3) supervised transformers trained from a random initialization, a flexible deep learning architecture\nthat retains the temporal information of each patient record. Each baseline model was trained independently\nfor its corresponding downstream task and evaluated using the same datasets and procedures as those applied\nto the CoMET foundational models.\nSample construction. For each downstream task, we applied the evaluation’s labeling logic to theCoMET\ntraining set to construct supervised examples. We used all supervised examples available in theCoMET\ntraining dataset up to a maximum of 5 million patient histories per task to fit the baselines. These samples\n24"}

Columns were\nnormalized such that the maximum absolute value of each feature in the training set was 1.0 before fitting the\nlinear and logistic models; XGBoost consumed raw counts. Preliminary experiments with inverse-frequency\nclass-weighting showed no material AUCROC gain on these large samples, so we report unweighted results\nfor simplicity.\nLinear and logistic regression. We trained linear models with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent for\nup to 1,000 epochs over the five million row dataset with early stopping after 5 epochs without improvement.\nClassification used a logistic loss; regression used a squared loss with an L1 regularization penalty.\nGradient-boosted decision trees. We used a gradient-boosted decision trees classifier or regressor with\nn_estimators= 10,000, max_depth= 6, learning_rate= 0.1, andsubsample= 0.8.

We trained the closest task-specific supervised counterpart to CoMET-M by\nusing the same architecture as CoMET-M (Table 3) and the same tokenized input prompts. Unlike the\nbag-of-words inputs, this baseline preserves model architecture and the temporal sequence information in the\noriginal prompts. We attached a task-specific classification or regression head to the model and optimized\nwith AdamW (weight decay 0.01), using a linear-decay schedule with warmup (500 warmup steps) and a peak\nlearning rate of1 ×10−4. Training ran for10,000 update steps (global batch size128; 1.28M samples). We\napplied gradient-norm clipping at1.0 and dropout 0.0.\nWe evaluated the supervised transformer baseline on a representative subset of tasks. The results are\nsummarized in Figure 25 and Table 15. Across the evaluated tasks, XGBoost consistently outperformed logistic\nregression and was generally stronger than the transformer baseline, despite requiring less compute. Based\non these findings, we used XGBoost as the primary task-specific supervised comparator but always report\nthe strongest baseline result obtained. Estimating the value added by pretraining and the transfer-learning it\nenables would require a deeper analysis of performance saturation under an unbounded task-specific compute\nbudget and is left to future work.\n5.5 Inference Details\nInference with CoMET was performed by generating future medical event sequences via Monte Carlo sampling.\nFor a given inference case, a patient history up to a specific moment was given as context to the model,\nand the model generated a specified numberd of output tokensn times at a temperature of 1, whered and\nn depended on the needs of the individual task. If the amount of patient history exceeded the size of the\nmodel’s context window (8,192 tokens for all CoMET models), the history is left-truncated as necessary.\nWhen this is necessary, the model loses the ability to see demographics and older information, but this aligns\nwith how the model sees truncated sequences during pretraining.\nAll of our evaluations ask questions about events over a specified time range, not number of tokens. The\nmodel’s ith generation is a series of tokens(yi1,yi2,...,y id), whereyij ∈V are tokens in the vocabularyV.\nTimes are assigned by incrementing the current time at generated time tokens based on the geometric midpoint\nof the interval.

Similar logic is used for getting the\nprobability of counts of events in generated sequences, as well as the distribution of time-to-event outcomes.\nFuture work is needed to improve model generations to always reachτ regardless of output length.\n5.6 Evaluation Details\nAll evaluations were performed using patients from the held-out test set of patients.\n5.6.1 Plausibility statistics\nWe selected 20,000 random patients and performed generations starting from the end of the patient’s last\nencounter that ended prior to 2022. To select for patients with some minimal degree of activity within health\nsystems contributing data to Cosmos, we required that these patients have at least one prior encounter as\nwell as one encounter beyond a year’s time from the generation start. We usedn= 25 generations for each\npatient, using up to 2000 tokens to reach one year’s time, and discarding those generations that did not reach\ntime. We used these generations to measure the percent of multi-token events that were invalid (Appendix C),\nthe prevalence and co-occurrence rates (Appendix D), and the probability calibrations of the number and\ntypes of encounters (Section 2.2.2). For prevalence and co-occurrence, we measured the overall agreement\nbetween ground truth and predicted rates using root-mean squared log error (RMSLE):\nRMSLE =\n√\nN∑\ni=1\n[log10(xi + ϵ) −log10(ˆxi + ϵ)]2 (3)\nwhere N is the number of event concepts, and(xi,ˆxi) are the prevalence or co-occurrence rate of individual\nconcepts in ground truth and generated sequences, makingRMSLE essentially the log-transformed root-mean\nsquare error (RMSE). For the probability calibration plots, we pooled patients into cohorts using equal\nquantile bin edges, and in each probability cohort measured the average predicted probability and the ground\ntruth positive fraction. We quantified overall calibration for each count bucket using expected calibration\nerror (ECE), which is just theMAE of the calibration curve with respect to the diagonal (i.e., perfect\ncalibration).\n5.6.2 Single-encounter generations\nEncounters were selected at random from across the test set without filtering for patients with a certain\namount of previous history. This was done to mimic real clinical practice. We evaluated encounters that\nwere either office visits, emergency visits, or inpatient admissions from the emergency department. For each\nencounter type, 10,000 encounters were selected, and all the medical events that occurred between encounter\nstart and encounter end were tabulated, specifically for diagnosis, medication, lab, and procedure data types.\nPrompts terminated at the end of the encounter header (i.e., encounter type, department specialty, and\nany chief complaints), and generations stopped once the model generated the appropriate encounter end\ntoken. Twenty generations were used per sample, with up to 2,000 tokens allowed per generation. In order to\nbe considered a true positive, the exact same code had to appear in both the patient simulation and the\nground truth encounter, even for multi-token diagnosis and medication events. Micro-averaged precision and\nrecall were computed for each encounter type and data type using different thresholds, andPR-AUC was\ndetermined from these precision-recall curves.\nFor reference points, we pooled together the medical events from the patient’s history prior to the encounter\nand measured the precision and recall of this method. We did this for different lookback windows, indicated\nby the gray dots in Figure 4.\n26"}

Continuous predictions of lab values were made by uniformly sampling from within the range of\nvalues encapsulated by the relevant lab’s quantile bucket. If multiple labs of the desired type were produced in\na given patient simulation, the average of the uniform samples was used. For all prediction types, generations\nthat did not reach the time thresholdtrequired by outcome definitions were discarded. CoMET was evaluated\non 30,000 samples per condition and predictions extracted from the model’s generations were micro-averaged\nover 80 generations per sample prior to calculating metrics.\n5.6.4 Incident Disease Risk Prediction\nAll tasks here were formulated as binary prediction of a patient disease state within a 2 year window. Each\nprediction point in this cohort is unique to one patient and was chosen to be the last instant of a randomly\nselected outpatient encounter between 2020 and 2022. All patients were required to have at least 2 encounters\nof either outpatient or “emergent” encounter types in the 2 years prior to the prediction date. “Emergent”\nencounters are inpatient admission, emergency department, and urgent care visits. Additionally, all patients\nwere required to be at least 18 and less than 120 years old at the prediction date to be included in these\ncohorts. For each incident disease prediction tasks, patients are excluded if they have had any of the diagnosis\ncodes of any type from the phenotype definition before the prediction point.\nEach target’s phenotype was classified as “chronic” or “emergent” and defined by a list ofICD-10-CM\ncodes within certain encounter types (see Table 24). A chronic target was marked positive if a diagnosis\nappeared in at least two outpatient encounters or in a single emergent encounter in the patient’s history.\nAn emergent target was marked positive only if a diagnosis occurred during an emergent encounter. Only\nencounter diagnoses and billing diagnoses were used for this target gathering. Patients in the ”Dementia\n(2yr)” cohort were also required to be 60 years or older at the prediction date to make the task more difficult.\nRoughly 5K patients and prediction points were sampled from the test set for each task (see Table 19 for\nexact counts). Since there were broad inclusion and minimal exclusion criteria, the dataset was naturally\nvery imbalanced with all tasks having <1.5% positive prevalence. Random upsampling on the minority class\nwas performed for each task cohort so at minimum 500 positive samples are present. During the calculation\nof performance metrics, samples were weighted by the inverse of the resampling factor so that the class\nproportions in the analysis matched those of in the full test set:\nw+ = Poriginal\n+\nPresample\n+\n, (4)\nw− = Poriginal\n−\nPresample\n−\n, (5)\nwhere w+ and w− are the weights assigned to positive and negative samples, andPoriginal\n± and Presample\n±\ndenote the number of positive/negative cases before and after up-sampling, respectively. These weights\nrestore the population-level prevalence, ensuring that prevalence-dependent metrics remain unbiased despite\nthe synthetic inflation of positives.\nInference on these tasks followed our typical strategy with the following modifications.

Each acute-on-chronic event prediction task consists\nof a chronic and an acute (”emergent”) phenotype, such as sickle cell disease and sickle cell crisis respectively.\nFind the full list of phenotypes in Table 24).\nTo be included in the prediction cohort, a patient must meet both the base inclusion criteria and have the\nchronic phenotype before the prediction date. This means they must have at least two outpatient encounters\nor one emergent encounter with a clinical or billed diagnosis code from the phenotype before the prediction\ndate.\nTo meet the acute phenotype criteria, a patient must have an emergent encounter with an encounter or\nbilling diagnosis code within the prediction window in their ground truth data. Patients who have already had\nthis acute event prior to the prediction date are still included within the cohort. A patient timeline generated\nby CoMET would be evaluated to have the target if the timeline has any occurrence of anyICD-10-CM codes\nfrom the acute phenotype within an emergent encounter. The same sampling strategy, sample weighting for\nperformance metrics, and sampling parameters as incident disease risk prediction are used in this evaluation.\nTable 19 has more details on dataset size and positive prevalence.\n5.6.6 Differential diagnosis\nFor theHPB and rheumatic diagnosis clusters, we selected 9 conditions from each to represent a range of\nprevalence and disease types. Specific definitions of each are in Table 22. Patients were selected for evaluation\nbased on the presence of relevant diagnosis codes in their record. We used retrospective inclusion based on\nthe diagnosis outcomes in order to focus this evaluation on patients who have one of the target diagnoses. In\norder to be included in a disease cohort, the patient had to have at least two occurrences of one of the eligible\nICD-10-CM codes at separate encounters (this was done to mitigate diagnoses documented as part of rule-out\ndiagnostic tests but for which the patient did not receive additional care). Time was measured relative to the\nencounter containing the first occurrence of an eligibleICD-10-CM code, which was then used as the index\ntime t= 0. Additionally, to be included, patients were required to both have an encounterprior toone year\nbefore the index diagnosis date as well as one encounterwithin one year before the index diagnosis date. We\nthen selected patients who received one of these diagnoses. Once a patient was selected, the first occurrence\nof each off-target diagnosis was identified for that patient. Selecting at most 9 random encounters from the\nyear prior to t= 0, we hadCoMET generate from the end of these encounters usingn= 40 generations and\nup to 2,000 output tokens to predict a patient’s 18-month risk of having that diagnosis. Additionally, we also\ngenerated from the encounter header for the encounter att= 0 to measureCoMET’s final predictions. We\nchose not to generate from within this encounter due to an increased chance of information leakage and to\nfocus the evaluation onearly diagnosis detection and differential diagnosis.\nFor the training of the task-specific supervised models, we selected many additional patients. For a\nproper comparison toCoMET, we chose to include patients who were being worked up for, or were at risk of\ndeveloping, a much wider set of diagnoses thanHPB or rheumatic diagnoses. This makes the comparison\nto CoMET more appropriate and also better reflects the diverse clinical scenarios a deployed system might\nencounter when flagging patients at risk of being diagnosed with specific diseases. For training, we expanded"}

For each hospital admission, we prompt CoMET with the patient’s history up until the point\nof admission (including the department specialty and any associated chief complaint and flagged primary\nencounter diagnosis events). We then generate up to 2,000 new tokens withn= 20 inpatient trajectories until\nthe encounter’s stop token appears. We take the median time-to-encounter-end as the model’s prediction.\n5.6.9 30-day readmission\nWe constructed prediction targets by selecting 10,000 patients discharged between January 1, 2020, and the\npresent date, subsequently determining whether these patients experienced a hospital readmission within 30\ndays. Readmissions occurring within 24 hours of discharge were excluded from this analysis because they\nmay often reflect hospital transfers or clerically erroneous discharges [33]. A 30-day readmission in aCoMET\ngeneration was defined as the beginning of a new inpatient encounter within 30 days of the discharge time.\n6 Acknowledgments\nWe thank Zach Galvin and Zhuowen Nie for managing the high-performance computing environment; Andrea\nNoel, Kersten Bartelt, and Jackie Gerhart for carefully reviewing our evaluations to ensure clinical accuracy;\nBrian Olson and Amy Kim for creating and advising on the graphic designs; Samson Race Dorfman for his\nhelp reviewing code and data quality; Phil Lindemann, Matthew Lungren, Jonathan Carlson, and Joe Petro\nfor project guidance; the Epic Cosmos R&D team for building and maintaining the essential infrastructure;\nand the Cosmos Community for the courage demonstrated in creating Cosmos, the dataset that made this\nwork possible.\nReferences\n[1] Alvin Rajkomar, Jeffrey Dean, and Isaac Kohane.

A\ndiagnostic event is considered invalid if there areICD-10-CM tokens in combination that do not correspond to\nreal ICD-10-CM codes. The same was done for medication orders withATCcodes. A lab result is considered\ninvalid if the lab token is not followed by a lab result quantile token. Encounter headers were considered\ninvalid if an encounter start token was not directly followed by a department specialty token (as noted in\nTable 5, not all encounters have a specified department specialty, but the encounter headers still have a token\nwith a specialty type of ’unspecified’). These experiments were done with 20,000 patients, each with 25 1-year\ngenerations. The denominator for each metric is the number of tokens that initiated an event.\nCoMET-SCoMET-MCoMET-L\n0.0%\n0.02%\n0.04%\n0.06%Percent invalid\nDiagnosis\nCoMET-SCoMET-MCoMET-L\n0.0%\n0.01%\n0.02%\n0.03%\n0.04%Percent invalid\nMedication\nCoMET-SCoMET-MCoMET-L\n0.0%\n0.0005%\n0.001%\n0.0015%Percent invalid\nLab Result\nCoMET-SCoMET-MCoMET-L\n0.0%\n0.005%\n0.01%\nPercent invalid\nEncounter Header\nFigure 19: Generation syntactic validity.The percent of diagnosis, medication, lab result, and encounter header\nevents that were invalidly generated by each of the CoMET models.\nAppendix D: Event prevalence and co-occurrence\nOne way to assess the plausibility ofCoMET’s generations is to measure the prevalence of generated medical\nevents. Given the model has to learn how to properly generate syntactically valid medical event sequences,\nit is not necessarily trivial to also learn the frequency at which different events of different types should\nappear for individual patients. For 20,000 patients, we generated 1 year’s worth of sequences 25 times and\nmeasured, on average, how many times different medical events occurred. We measured this for diagnoses (at\nthe 3-characterICD-10-CM code level for simplicity), labs, medications, and procedures, as seen in Figure 20.\nIn addition to measuring agreement in the prevalence of single events in generated sequences, we next\nasked whether pairs of events co-occur within a patient’s generated sequence the proper amount. This\nsecond-degree question is a quick, aggregate measure that the model understands the relationship between\nevents, both within and across data types. We measured the fraction of patients in which each possible pair\nof events co-occurred. Results in Figure 20 and Table 6 show thatCoMET generally does well at generating\nevents at the same rate of co-occurrence as observed in real patient medical event sequences.\n42"}

Their applications span code\ngeneration [17], question answering [37], mathematical reasoning\n[19], and interactive agents [78, 100]. As these applications grow in\ncomplexity, so too does the sophistication of prompting techniques\nused to elicit desired behaviors from LLMs. Advanced prompting\nstrategies such as chain-of-thought [97], few-shot in-context learn-\ning [14], and ReAct (reasoning and acting) [101] have emerged as\ncritical methods for improving model performance.\nWithin this evolving landscape, “structured prompting” [72, 95,\n104] has gained prominence as a systematic approach to organizing\ninstructions and context data within prompts. These structured\napproaches offer numerous advantages: they componentize and\nstandardize prompts for better automated editing [ 74], facilitate\nteam collaboration [68], improve development efficiency [13], sup-\nport fine-grained editing [24], enable reuse of proven designs [95],\nand potentially boost performance [44]. As LLM applications in-\ncreasingly integrate multiple data types – including images [83],\ntables [80], and documents [ 45], the need for a more organized\napproach to prompt design becomes increasingly apparent.\nDespite these advances, prompt engineering faces four signif-\nicant challenges that impede effective development and deploy-\nment of LLM applications. First, current practices lack standardized\nmethods for the structured orchestration of prompts . Projects\nfollowing “structured prompting” practices often involve scattered\ninstructions, roles, tasks, and examples [95, 104], hindering main-\ntenance and collaboration, especially in complex projects. Second,\nintegrating diverse data sources remains complex. Large LLM\napplications increasingly require references to documents [45], ta-\nbles [18, 103], or images [46]. Properly integrating and presenting\nthese varied sources within prompts poses a significant engineering\nburden. Third, LLMs exhibit significant sensitivity to formatting\nand presentation [73, 76, 89]. Research has documented “butterfly\neffects, ” where minor textual variations can dramatically alter re-\nsults. The absence of a decoupled styling layer complicates system-\natic testing and refinement of prompt variations [48, 75]. Finally,\nprompt development and management suffer from inadequate\ntooling. Current workflows often lack effective version control\nand diff visibility [24], making tracking changes and collaboration\ndifficult. Plain-text prompts are cumbersome to manage [11, 102],\nand limited IDE support hinders systematic improvement [9, 79].\nSeveral existing approaches attempt to address these challenges,\nbut each has its specific limitations. Workflow and agent orches-\ntration tools like LangChain [ 3], Microsoft Guidance [ 53], and\nPromptChainer [98] manage multi-step flows but treat prompts\nas plain text or minimal templates, lacking structured data presen-\ntation or advanced styling capabilities. Markup-based prompting\napproaches such as ChatML [ 77], MDXPrompt [ 30], PromptML\n[68], and VSCode PromptTSX [90] provide component-based frame-\nworks but lack effective data handling, a well-separated styling\nsystem, or comprehensive development support. User interfaces for\nprompt comparison or logging exist [9, 57], yet lack the fundamen-\ntal tools to author or structure prompts before running comparisons\nor evaluations.\nTo address these multifaceted challenges comprehensively, we\nintroduce POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language) ."}

User interfaces for\nprompt comparison or logging exist [9, 57], yet lack the fundamen-\ntal tools to author or structure prompts before running comparisons\nor evaluations.\nTo address these multifaceted challenges comprehensively, we\nintroduce POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language) .\nPOML provides a novel paradigm designed to bring structure, main-\ntainability, and versatility to advanced prompt engineering. POML\nis based on an HTML-like structured markup language featur-\ning semantic components, such as<role>, <task>, and <example>,\nencouraging modular design and enhancing prompt reusability. To\nease data integration, POML incorporates specialized data compo-\nnents (e.g., <document>, <table>, <img>) that seamlessly embed\nor reference external data sources like text files, spreadsheets, and\nimages [18, 99]. These data components offer customizable for-\nmatting options and eliminate error-prone manual text merging.\nTo address format sensitivity, POML introduces astyling system\ninspired by CSS [ 26, 94]. This decouples content from presenta-\ntion, allowing developers to modify styling (e.g., verbosity, syntax\nformat) via separate <stylesheet> definitions (Figure 1 (c)) and\nsystematically experiment with format variations without altering\ncore logic. POML also includes a built-in templating engine for\ndynamically generating complex, data-driven prompts.\nBeyond the language itself, POML addresses inadequate tooling\nwith a comprehensive development toolkit. This includes an In-\ntegrated Development Environment (IDE) extension (initially for\nVisual Studio Code, see Figure 1 (1)) providing essential develop-\nment aids like real-time previews (g), inline diagnostics (e), and\nauto-completion (f). The toolkit also provides Software Develop-\nment Kits (SDKs) for seamless integration into Python and Node.js\napplications [3, 54]. Overall, the toolkit streamlines the prompt\nengineering lifecycle, enhancing authoring efficiency, debugging,\nversion control (Figure 1 (a)), collaboration, and the systematic\nevolution of prompts.\nWe validate the effectiveness and utility of POML through rig-\norous empirical evaluation. This includes two distinct case studies\nand a formal user study. The first case study showcases POML’s\npractical application in building PomLink – an iOS agent applica-\ntion prototype (Figure 1 (2)). This study highlights how POML’s\ndata components, styling, and tooling enabled the rapid develop-\nment (a functional prototype in two days) of a complex application\nprototype requiring integration of documents, images, and tables.\nThe second case study, focusing on Table Question Answering\n(TableQA), systematically explores the impact of prompt styling\nusing POML’s styling system. It demonstrates that stylistic varia-\ntions, easily managed by POML, can cause dramatic, model-specific\ndifferences in LLM performance (e.g., accuracy improvements over\n9x for some models) on table-based reasoning tasks [64]. Finally,\nour user study involving participants with varying expertise as-\nsessed POML’s usability across five representative tasks [20, 102].\nThe results confirmed POML’s effectiveness in structuring prompts\nand handling data, with participants particularly valuing the data\ncomponents and development toolkits, while also providing con-\nstructive feedback for future enhancements.\nThe primary contributions of this work are:"}

This sensitivity is particularly pronounced\nwhen prompts involve complex data types such as tables, charts,\nor images, where carefully tuned presentation is often necessary\nfor reliable results [18, 31, 36, 99, 103]. Indeed, research highlights\na “butterfly effect, ” where minor variations in phrasing, formatting,\nmarkup, or content order can dramatically alter LLM outputs and\naccuracy [35, 48, 73, 89, 106].\nConsequently, prompt engineering – the practice of design-\ning inputs to optimize LLM outputs – has become essential [ 72].\nResearch has shown that enhancing prompts with in-context ex-\namples or iterative reasoning steps significantly improves results\n[14, 25, 96, 97, 101]. Within this field, structured prompting has\nemerged as a key practice, organizing prompts into standardized\nroles, tasks, or program-like formats [ 51, 66, 74, 95, 104]. Such\napproaches offer advantages including improved reusability and\nmaintainability [13, 24, 44, 68, 74, 95]. Conversely, unstructured\nprompts often impede team-based workflows, making targeted\nmodifications difficult without affecting other prompt sections [24].\nThe lack of clear boundaries or standardized documentation for\nprompt segments (e.g., roles, tasks, examples) hinders the develop-\nment of shared tooling for parsing, manipulating, or reusing prompt\ncomponents programmatically.\n2.2 Prompt Development Challenges and\nTooling\nStudies on Prompt Usage and Challenges Studies on prompt\nusage patterns reveal significant challenges faced by users, espe-\ncially non-experts. Minimalist web/chat UIs like OpenAI’s Play-\nground and ChatGPT [59, 60] serve as short-term sandboxes, leav-\ning a gap between experimental prototyping and large-scale and\nproduction-ready prompt designs. In industry, trial-and-error ap-\nproaches are common but hinder systematic improvements, as users\noften make erroneous assumptions about how to communicate with\nLLMs [20, 102]. This continuous editing process also makes prompt\nhistory tracking difficult, complicating version control and collabo-\nration. Text-based prompts frequently become opaque or difficult to\nmanage over time [11, 24]. Tagging approaches are being explored\nto alleviate these issues by improving differential comparisons and\ncollaborative editing [68, 95], aligning with structured prompting\npractices.\nPrompt Toolkits for Development and Evaluation Several\nintegrated prompt toolkits have been developed to assist users in\nprompt engineering. Flow-based or multi-prompt systems provide\npipelines for chaining multiple prompts with optional retrieval com-\nponents in complex LLM applications [3, 53, 54, 98].

However, these systems typically\nmanage the high-level orchestration of multiple steps or prompts,\noften treating individual prompts as opaque strings or simple tem-\nplates, rather than providing detailed frameworks for structuring\nthe content within a single complex prompt. POML can integrate\nwith these systems as a specialized syntax for enhanced clarity\nand structure within individual prompt steps. Another stream of\nexisting works is prompt evaluation interfaces, offering UIs for com-\nparing or perturbing prompts [4, 9, 57, 67, 79]. These are largely\northogonal to POML’s focus on prompt authoring and structure,\nand could potentially use POML’s declared sub-blocks for more\nfine-grained testing and analysis.\n2.3 Web Frameworks and Prompt Markup\nLanguages\nInspiration from Web Frameworks and Programming The\nevolution of web development offers relevant parallels and insights\nfor prompt engineering. Both domains share concerns around clar-\nity, dynamic content, and adaptable layouts – whether for different\nscreen sizes or context windows [49]. Principles like the separation\nof structure (HTML [12, 27]), presentation (CSS [26, 94]), and behav-\nior (JavaScript [28]) have proven crucial for managing complexity\nin web development, providing a blueprint for prompt frameworks.\nEarly dynamic websites relied on templating engines to map data\ninto presentation views [29, 34, 40, 56, 85], akin to simple prompt\ntemplating in tools like LangChain [ 3] or Guidance [ 53]. A sig-\nnificant advancement came with component-based frameworks\n[5, 70, 91], which encapsulate structure, style, and logic into reusable\nunits, enhancing modularity and maintainability [ 42, 81, 87, 88].\nBuilding upon these frameworks, UI component libraries such as\nAnt Design [23] and MUI [58] provide extensive sets of pre-defined,\nhigh-level components (“widgets”) that further accelerate develop-\nment by offering ready-to-use solutions for common UI patterns,\noften including advanced data display capabilities. Languages like\nJSX [69], used extensively in React [70], exemplify this by allowing\ndevelopers to define UI “components” using declarative,markup-like\nsyntax combined with programming logic. This component-based\napproach improves code readability and fosters reuse. Conversely,\nmanually constructing structured outputs via string concatena-\ntion is notoriously error-prone and hinders readability [15]. These\nlessons underscore the potential benefits of applying similar prin-\nciples — using components, templates, and structured markup —\nto manage the complexity of modern prompt engineering, a core\nmotivation for POML."}

Some approaches\nleverage JSX/TSX syntax within TypeScript (TS) for templating\nprompts [8, 10, 90]. These often prioritize adapting to context win-\ndow lengths but may offer limited built-in features for complex data\ninput handling or advanced styling mechanisms. Other frameworks\nadopt broader React-inspired workflows or component models for\norchestrating agent interactions or generating complex outputs\n[32, 33]. These systems typically offer limited control over the fi-\nnal prompt string’s styling or the embedding of diverse data types\ndirectly via markup. MDXPrompt [30] integrates MDX syntax for\nprompts but requires TypeScript API usage to render dynamic\ncontent, coupling the prompt definition to the execution environ-\nment. These approaches attempt to “componentize” prompts with\nHTML-like syntax but are limited in “widget-level” data input en-\ncapsulation, or focus primarily on high-level agent or workflow\norchestration rather than providing comprehensive prompt-level\nstructuring and styling solutions.\nOutside the JS/TS ecosystem, other markup solutions propose\nstructured tags but typically focus more on conversational chat\nformats or specialized formats for LLM training [13, 77]. PromptML\n[68], while advocating for a domain-specific language to improve\nstandardization and collaboration, currently lacks integrated devel-\nopment environment support, such as syntax highlighting, which\ncan affect usability and adoption. SAMMO [75] operates at a higher-\nlevel abstraction, representing prompts symbolically to allow for\ntransformations and optimization searches. While these solutions\nprovide intention-expressive tags or enable powerful symbolic ma-\nnipulations, they generally lack built-in styling layers, flexible data\nimport features across multiple formats, or comprehensive IDE\ntoolkits. Many existing markup or programmatic approaches are\nalso tightly bound to specific programming languages (e.g., Python),\nlimiting flexibility. In contrast, POML aims to unify structured\nmarkup, effective data handling, decoupled styling, and integrated\ntemplating within a standalone language specification, supported\nby a comprehensive toolkit and SDKs for broader compatibility\nand ease of use across different development environments. A ta-\nble summarizing the key differences between POML and existing\nprompt markup languages is provided in Appendix A.\n3 Motivations and Design Goals\n3.1 Motivations\nInsights gathered from preliminary discussions with 5 prompt en-\ngineers in our research group highlighted 4 pressing challenges in\ncontemporary prompt engineering. These challenges directly moti-\nvate our design of POML as a comprehensive solution for prompt\ndevelopment.\nM1: Structured Prompt Orchestration Necessity While the\nbenefits of structured prompting are increasingly recognized [13,\n24, 44, 68, 74, 95], a significant problem lies in the lack of a stan-\ndardized framework for implementation. Current practices often\nresult in ad-hoc approaches using unstructured plain text where\ninstructions, roles, tasks, and examples are scattered inconsistently\nthroughout prompts [51, 95, 104]. This absence of standardization\nmakes prompts difficult to maintain, optimize, and reuse, especially\nwithin collaborative development environments.\nM2: Complexity in Data Integration Large LLM applications\nincreasingly rely on varied data formats, requiring references to\ndocuments [45], tables [18, 103], or images [46]. Integrating these\ndiverse data sources becomes chaotic and error-prone. Manual\ntext shaping, multi-point editing, and frequent reformatting signif-\nicantly hamper maintainability [24, 36]. Existing tools often rely\non ad-hoc placeholders or separate scripts for data embedding\n[3, 11, 54], lacking effective, integrated solutions."}

This sensitivity underscores the need for structured\ncontrol over prompt presentation. The absence of a mechanism to\ndecouple presentation style from prompt content makes it difficult\nto systematically test, refine, or adapt prompt formats for different\nmodels or tasks [48, 75].\nM4: Prompt Development and Management Challenges Cur-\nrent prompt development workflows suffer from poor diff visibility\nand version control [24], making it difficult to track changes and col-\nlaborate effectively. Existing prompt markup languages [13, 30, 68]\noften lack syntax highlighting, auto-completion, preview and de-\nbugging tools, increasing the learning curve and error rate. Many\nsolutions [33, 90] are tightly bound to particular programming\nlanguages or frameworks, limiting their integration with existing\ndevelopment tools and workflows. These limitations hinder the effi-\nciency of development and make prompt management increasingly\ndifficult as projects scale.\n3.2 Design Goals\nBased on these motivations, we established four core design goals\nfor POML, each intended to address one of the identified challenges.\nThese goals focus on standardizing syntax, supporting effective data\nhandling, separating styling from content, and providing developer-\nfocused tooling.\nDG1: Reusable and Maintainable Prompt Markup A primary\ngoal is to provide a standardized, JSX-like markup language that\ninherently supports structured prompting practices (M1). The lan-\nguage should enhance prompt clarity and ensure that prompt logic\nis easily refactorable and shareable across projects or teams. It\nshould support a hierarchical nesting structure to reflect logical re-\nlationships and improve flexibility. Furthermore, the system should\noffer commonly used elements like roles, tasks, or few-shot exam-\nples, promoting modularity and consistency in line with structured\nprompting approaches [95, 104].\nDG2: Comprehensive Data Handling To address the complex-\nities of data integration ( M2), the system should offer effective\nand comprehensive data handling capabilities, including dynamic\nprompt generation. Specialized components should be provided to\nseamlessly embed commonly used static data sources into prompts,\nincluding documents, tables, and images [18, 45, 99]. These compo-\nnents should preserve important data details while offering easy-to-\nuse interfaces for adjusting presentation formats (e.g., syntaxes for"}

Fur-\nthermore, the language itself should support integrated templating\nlogic (variables, loops, conditionals) as most data are only available\nat the runtime. Support for fallback text for non-textual datashould\nalso be included to accommodate LLMs with varying multi-modal\ncapabilities and enhance prompt robustness across models.\nDG3: Decoupled Presentation Specifications To manage LLM\nsensitivity to formatting ( M3), a core design goal is to provide\nflexible control over prompt presentation while simultaneously\ndecoupling these presentation specifications (styling) from the core\nprompt content. This separation should allow styling rules (e.g.,\nbullet style, syntax format, verbosity) to be defined centrally with\nminimized modifications to prompt contents. The system should\nsupport format configurations at multiple levels (e.g., both overall\nsyntax and local syntax) to adapt prompts easily to different LLM\nsensitivities or task requirements [ 35, 48]. This decoupling will\nideally enable rapid testing and optimization while maintaining\ncontent integrity.\nDG4: Enhanced Tooling for Development To address devel-\nopment and management challenges ( M4), the framework must\nbe accompanied by enhanced tooling. It should utilize standalone\nprompt files with a clear structure, facilitating integration with stan-\ndard version control systems like Git and improving readability and\ncollaborative editing. Dedicated IDE support should be provided\nwith essential features like syntax highlighting, context-aware auto-\ncompletion, hover documentation, inline diagnostics, and a live\npreview. Finally, the systemshould maintain interoperability with\npopular LLM frameworks (e.g., LangChain [3] and Guidance [53])\nthrough integration SDKs, allowing seamless integration into exist-\ning development workflows.\n4 POML: Prompt Orchestration Markup\nLanguage\nPOML, standing for Prompt Orchestration Markup Language, in-\ntroduces a novel structured paradigm designed for authoring, man-\naging, and testing prompts for LLMs. This section provides an\noverview of POML’s foundational elements, including its core syn-\ntax based on HTML principles, its features for integrating diverse\ndata types, its styling system for formatting prompt content, and\na templating engine for dynamic prompt generation. These fea-\ntures address common challenges in prompt engineering. POML’s\nhierarchical structure enhances clarity and reusability (DG1). Its\ndata components streamline the integration of varied information\nsources (DG2). Its styling system manages LLM formatting sensi-\ntivities (DG3). Its overall design combined with tooling (introduced\nin § 5) supports an enhanced development experience (DG4).\n4.1 Structured Prompting Markup\nThe fundamental syntax of POML adopts an HTML-like structure,\nclosely mirroring HTML conventions. This design choice stems\nfrom the observation that prompt engineering shares similarities\nwith web design; both involve crafting interfaces — textual for\nLLMs, visual for humans — that require clear hierarchy, consistent\npresentation, and adaptability.

Nested tags (called components in\nour case) form the overall structure, enabling the hierarchical com-\nposition of complex prompts from smaller, modular parts. Within\nthese tags, attributes provide metadata or configure the behavior\nof individual components, similar to how attributes like src or\nhreffunction in HTML. POML supports standard HTML comment\nsyntax, <!– ... –>, allowing developers to embed annotations\nwithin the prompt source code without affecting rendering. POML\nalso maintains compatibility with plain text, allowing for gradual\nadoption. The root <poml> tag is optional, akin to the optional\n<html> tag in web development, which minimizes overhead for\nsimple prompts where only specific features like data embedding\nmight initially be needed."}

Elements like <b>(bold), <i>(italic),\n<p>(paragraph), and <div>(division) allow for control over\ntext presentation and logical grouping within larger content\nblocks, enhancing readability and structure. Alongside these\nstatic elements, POML includes components and syntax for\ndynamic content generation through its integrated templat-\ning engine, such as constructs for loops (for), conditionals\n(if), variable definition (<let>), and substitution ({{...}}).\nThese templating features are detailed further in § 4.4.\n•Intention Components define the core logic and overall\nstructure of the prompt. These components implement the\n“structured prompting” paradigm [30, 51, 68, 95, 104], estab-\nlishing the interaction’s purpose and guiding the LLM’s re-\nsponse. Examples include the <role> component, used to\ndefine the persona the LLM should adopt; the<task>compo-\nnent, which specifies the objective the LLM needs to achieve;\nand the <example> component, crucial for providing few-\nshot demonstrations to guide the model’s behavior. Unlike\ndata components, intention components organize the logical\nblocks of the prompt rather than presenting complex data\ndirectly. When rendered, components like <role>typically\nappear as formatted titles (e.g., **Role:**), with the presen-\ntation adjustable via styling rules (§ 4.3). These intention\ncomponents orchestrate the overall flow and content of the\nprompt, as illustrated in Figure 2.\n•Data Components are designed to handle the integration\nof diverse external data formats into the prompt context.\nElements such as <document>, <img>, and <table> provide\nmethods to embed content from files or data structures. These\ncomponents, detailed in § 4.2, are essential for grounding\nLLM responses in specific information or enabling tasks that\noperate on external data.\nRationale This hierarchical and descriptive markup enforces\na logical organization, offering significant advantages over un-\nstructured plain text. For instance, as illustrated in Figure 2, the\nexplicit separation of conceptual parts — using intention com-\nponents like <role> and <task>, structuring instructions with\n<stepwise-instructions>, defining outputs with<output-format>,\nand providing few-shot demonstrations [14] via <example>(which\nitself nests <input>containing data components like <table>and\n<output>referencing an external <doc>) — significantly improves\nprompt clarity and understandability, reducing ambiguity for both\nLLMs and human readers. These components, such as the tables\nshown integrated directly or within examples, can then be easily\nreused across different prompts or modified in isolation, fostering\nsystematic prompt engineering (DG1). Compared to simpler for-\nmats like PromptML [68], which primarily offer basic task and exam-\nple definitions, POML provides richer semantic components crucial\nfor handling diverse content types (DG2). Meanwhile, the modu-\nlarity allows individual components to be treated as self-contained\nunits. Modifying components independently minimizes the risk of\nunintended side effects elsewhere in the prompt, facilitating faster\nand safer iterations, supporting more agile development workflows.\nThe combination of a standardized, text-based format and clearly\nnamed elements simplifies prompt management within standard\nversion control systems like Git (Figure 1 (a)). This enhances col-\nlaboration, as changes become easier to track, merge, and discuss\n(DG4).\n4.2 Data Components\nPOML provides specialized data components to systematically inte-\ngrate diverse data modalities directly within the prompt structure,\nas exemplified in Figure 3.

This capability directly addresses the\ncritical need to combine LLM reasoning with varied external data\nsources, a key requirement for many advanced applications (DG2).\nPOML’s modular data components reduce the inherent complexity\nassociated with constructing prompts that incorporate multiple data\ninputs. These built-in components distinguish POML by offering\nsystematic handling for common data types within a unified frame-\nwork, analogous to component libraries in modern UI frameworks\n[23, 58]. Currently, POML supports 7 distinct data components :\ndocument, table, folder, image, conversational messages, audio clip,\nweb page. We detail 4 representative examples here; the remain-\ning components operate similarly and are demonstrated in the case\nstudies (§ 7).\nDocument The document component (Figure 3 (a)) provides a\nmechanism for referencing and embedding content from external\ntext-based files, supporting formats like.txt, .docx, and.pdf. This\nis particularly crucial for tasks involving large amounts of back-\nground information or context, such as in retrieval-augmented gen-\neration (RAG) systems [16, 45]. It offers granular control through at-\ntributes, allowing developers to specify character encoding, whether\nto preserve original formatting, whether to include or discard\nembedded images within documents like PDFs, and how to trim\ncontent — for instance, by selecting specific page ranges (e.g.,\nselectedPages=\"1:3\") — thereby helping manage the LLM’s lim-\nited context window.\nFolder For scenarios involving interaction with file systems or\ncode repositories, such as file system analysis, code reviews, and\nproject navigation [39, 47, 86], the <folder>component (Figure 3\n(b)) provides a structured way to represent directory hierarchies. It\nallows customization of the representation through attributes con-\ntrolling the maximum depth of the displayed tree, filtering options\nto include or exclude files based on extensions or name patterns\n(e.g., filter=\"ˆ(?!__).*\\.py\"), and optional automatic summa-\nrization for very large directories to conserve context space. It can\nalso display metadata like file sizes or modification dates and sup-\nports multiple output formats, including classic tree views using\nbox-drawing characters, YAML, or JSON representations.\nTable Tables are vital for complex question-answering over struc-\ntured data [64], generating data visualizations [18], or performing\ndata manipulation tasks [103]. The <table> component (Figure 3\n(c)) supports a variety of input sources, including CSV, TSV, Ex-\ncel spreadsheets, and JSON arrays of objects. Crucially, it allows\nspecifying the output representation (e.g., Markdown, HTML, XML,\nplain CSV) and controlling content details such as the inclusion of"}

Employing a\nconsistent and well-defined table format via this component can sig-\nnificantly enhance an LLM’s ability to accurately parse and reason\nover the tabular data, applicable to scenarios like [36, 80, 103].\nImage Acknowledging the rapid advancement of multimodal\nLLMs capable of processing visual information [62, 83], POML in-\ncludes the <img>component (Figure 3 (d)) for direct image insertion\ninto prompts. Inspired by web accessibility principles [92–94], this\ncomponent supports standard attributes like alt text, allowing\nprompts to be easily adapted to LLMs with varying capabilities,\nincluding those without vision, thereby enhancing robustness. Lay-\nout can be influenced using a position attribute (e.g., before,\nafter, here) to control placement relative to surrounding text. At-\ntributes like maxWidthand maxHeightallow developers to suggest\nrendering constraints, potentially influencing the number of tokens\nconsumed when sending image data to the model. Compared to\ninteractive uploads in chat interfaces [ 21, 60] or less structured\nparameter passing in raw API calls [62, 83], inserting images via a\ndedicated component within the markup offers superior program-\nmatic control and integration.\nExtensions POML’s architecture is designed to be extensible.\nAs LLMs evolve to handle new modalities, POML can incorporate\nadditional data components for types like video segments and node-\nedge graphs, maintaining a consistent framework for diverse data\nintegration.\n4.3 Styling System\nA critical challenge in prompt engineering stems from the docu-\nmented sensitivity of LLMs to subtle variations in input formatting\n[35, 73, 76, 89, 106]. Minor changes in presentation can signifi-\ncantly impact model performance, necessitating precise control\nover how prompt content is rendered (DG3). POML addresses this\nthrough a dedicated styling system designed to manage presenta-\ntion effectively. The styling options provided, such as control over\nsyntax formats, layout adjustments (e.g., chat vs. block formatting),\nlist styles, and caption presentation, are informed by findings in\nprompt engineering research exploring these sensitivities [48, 76].\nInspired by the separation of concerns in web development (HTML"}

POML offers two\nprimary mechanisms for applying styles: inline attributes and ex-\nternal stylesheets .\nPOML provides control over various presentation aspects known\nto influence LLM behavior, such as layout adjustments (e.g., chat\nversus block formatting), list styles ( <list listStyle=\"deci-\nmal\">), caption presentation (<hint caption=\"Important Note\"\ncaptionStyle=\"header\">), and overall verbosity [48, 76]. Beyond\nsimple formatting, POML provides a crucialsyntax attribute. This\nattribute allows developers to explicitly control the rendering for-\nmat for specific components or the entire prompt (e.g., <table\nsyntax=\"html\"/>or <poml syntax=\"json\">). This control is vital\nbecause different LLMs can exhibit varying sensitivities or capabili-\nties when parsing structured formats like Markdown, JSON, or XML\n[7] embedded within the prompt text. The styling attributes can\nbe nested, allowing, for example, a subsection of a predominantly\nMarkdown-formatted prompt to be rendered as JSON, providing\nfine-grained control over the final string sent to the model.

These files contain global formatting rules defined\nusing a concise, JSON-like syntax. Style rules within the stylesheet\ntarget specific POML component types (e.g., hint, table) or user-\ndefined classes (see § 7.2 for examples). Alternatively, these style\nrules can also be embedded directly within a POML document using\nthe <stylesheet>tag, as shown in Figure 1 (c). Overall, stylesheets\nprovide a mechanism to define styles that apply globally or to spe-\ncific component types, offering a way to batch-manage or customize\nstyles that might otherwise be set inline individually. They offer\nseveral advantages: (1) it provides centralized control, establishing\na single source of truth for formatting; (2) it keeps the primary\nprompt logic cleaner by avoiding repetitive presentation attributes;\n(3) it simplifies style modifications by eliminating multi-point ed-\nits, enhancing maintainability. As a result, this approach directly\nfacilitates systematic experimentation with different presentation\nformats to address LLM sensitivities or task requirements (DG3)\nwithout altering the core prompt content.\n4.4 Templating Engine\nPOML integrates a built-in templating engine to facilitate the cre-\nation of dynamic, data-driven prompts without execution environ-\nment dependencies (DG2).

This tight\nfeedback loop facilitates iterative refinement and assessment of\nprompt compatibility across LLMs, addressing model sensitivities\n(DG3) and accelerating the write-debug-validate cycle.\nLSP Server The IntelliSense features described above — includ-\ning hover information, auto-completion, and inline diagnostics\n— are powered by a dedicated implementation of the Language\nServer Protocol (LSP) [52]. Leveraging the standardized LSP allows\nthese rich language-specific capabilities to be provided consistently.\nCaching and throttling are implemented at the side of LSP server,\nensuring that the client (e.g., VSCode) remains responsive and does\nnot experience performance degradation during heavy usage. This\narchitectural choice not only enhances the development experience\ncurrently within VSCode but also creates the potential for inte-\ngrating POML IntelliSense into other LSP-compatible editors (e.g.,\nEmacs, PyCharm) in the future.\n5.2 Node.js and Python SDKs\nTo facilitate integration into larger software applications, POML\nprovides Software Development Kits (SDKs) for the Node.js (JavaScript\n/ TypeScript) and Python environments, chosen for their prevalence\nin web development and AI respectively (Figure 8).\nThe Node.js SDK (Figure 8 (a)) allows programmatic POML\ndefinition using familiar JavaScript paradigms like JSX syntax or\nReact-style functional components [33, 90]. This approach supports\ncreating typed, composable prompt components that can be ver-\nsioned and shared using standard tools like npm. It also enables\ndevelopers to define custom, extensible POML components using\nTypeScript or JavaScript, allowing the core language to be aug-\nmented within specific application contexts.\nSimilarly, the Python SDK (Figure 8 (b)) offers an idiomatic\ninterface using context managers and a fluent API builder pattern,\ninspired by libraries likeyattag[43]. This design facilitates integra-\ntion into Python-based AI/ML workflows, for instance, dynamically\ncreating prompts within data processing pipelines or interacting\nwith frameworks like LangChain [3]. Importantly, the Python tool-\ning also supports a standalone mode, allowing direct processing of\n.pomlfiles via scripts or command-line tools, ideal for rapid testing\nas demonstrated in our TableQA case study (§ 7.2).\nCrucially, both SDKs support programmatic generation and ma-\nnipulation of stylesheets. This capability enables advanced use\ncases, such as the automated exploration and optimization of prompt\nstyles. They are also compatible with popular LLM client libraries,\nsimplifying the integration of POML-generated prompts into the\nLLM communication layer. Furthermore, the language-agnostic\ndesign of the core POML specification also allows for the potential\ndevelopment of SDKs in other languages (e.g., C#, Java, Go) in the\nfuture."}

Furthermore, the language-agnostic\ndesign of the core POML specification also allows for the potential\ndevelopment of SDKs in other languages (e.g., C#, Java, Go) in the\nfuture.\n6 Implementation\nCore Technology Stack The core POML engine is developed\nusing TypeScript, leveraging the React framework combined with\nServer-Side Rendering (SSR) [71]. React’s component model nat-\nurally supports POML’s design philosophy centered on separable\nand reusable prompt components. SSR facilitates the efficient han-\ndling of asynchronous operations, such as processing external data\nsources like images or documents referenced within prompts.\nCodebase Overview The POML codebase currently comprises\napproximately 14.8k lines of TypeScript code. This implementa-\ntion realizes the POML language specification, encompassing 37\ndistinct components (categorized into 14 basic structural, 7 data, 11\nintention, and 5 utility components) and a total of 283 attributes.\nThe codebase is divided into approximately 11.3k lines for the core\nengine functionality, 3.4k lines for the Visual Studio Code extension\nfeatures (§ 5.1), and 96 lines for a lightweight Python SDK wrap-\nper (§ 5.2). Comprehensive testing validates the implementation\nthrough 10 test suites containing 115 distinct test cases. These tests\ncover diverse scenarios, including basic tag parsing, attribute vali-\ndation, complex multi-modal data integration, nested component\nstructures, and the correct application of styling rules, verifying\nrobustness of core POML features.\nRendering Architecture The POML implementation employs a\nthree-pass rendering architecture to enhance modularity and ex-\ntensibility. First, a Parser pass validates the input POML markup,\nexecutes templating logic (loops, conditionals), resolves variables,\napplies styles, and transforms the source code into React JSX com-\nponents. Second, React processes these components, and generates\na comprehensive Intermediate Representation (IR) . This IR is a\nstructured tree containing the resolved content, computed styles,\nand associated metadata. Third, a dedicated Writer pass traverses\nthe IR and serializes it into the final target output format (e.g.,\nMarkdown, JSON, plain text). This separation of concerns signifi-\ncantly enhances flexibility; for instance, it enables support for new"}

This case\nstudy highlights POML’s capability to streamline the integration of\ndiverse data sources within a functional LLM-powered mobile ap-\nplication. PomLink functions as an LLM agent that utilizes context\nderived from “linked” files, which users can upload via dedicated\ninterface buttons supporting various types including documents, ta-\nbles, images, webpages, and voice memos (Figure 9 (1)), all of which\ncan be tailored to personalized settings. For example, tapping the\n“Files” button (Figure 9 (b)) initiates a pop-up window, asking the\nuser to select multiple documents or tables from the file system\n(Figure 9 (c)), with an optionally adjusted inclusion style, which\nare then linked to the agent’s session. Once files are linked, users\ncan have a conversation with the agent (Figure 1 (2); Figure 9 (1)).\nThis interface enables both customized “ask anything” queries and\nthe use of predefined task shortcuts like “Translate”, “Summarize”,\n“Rewrite”, and “Brainstorm”. These shortcuts operate on the context\nprovided by both the linked files and the rich multi-modal chat his-\ntory.

The primary objectives of this case study were twofold: first,\nto validate POML’s effectiveness by integrating it into a functional\nmobile application prototype; and second, to assess how POML’s\nfeatures aided the development process, particularly in handling\ndiverse data inputs and managing prompt complexity within this\napplication.\nPomLink’s core agent functionality relies extensively on POML\nfor structuring the prompts used to interact with LLMs. This struc-\nture incorporated several key POML features, visible in the example\nprompt within the development environment shown in Figure 1\n(b). Specifically, we used:\n•An <include> component to modularly incorporate a com-\nmon system prompt stored in a separate file, enhancing\nreusability and maintainability.\n•The <conversation> component to present the conversa-\ntional history between the user and the agent systematically,\ncrucial for maintaining context in interactive sessions.\n•Components like <role>, <task>, and <output-format>to\nprovide a clear structure based on the RTF prompting frame-\nwork [104], organizing instructions for both the LLM and\nhuman developers.\n•Various data components (§ 4.2) to integrate content from\nthe linked files selected by the user.\n•The styling system (§ 4.3) to define formatting rules centrally\nand create distinct style profiles (e.g., compact vs. verbose),\nallowing adaptation to specific tasks or backend LLMs.\nIntegrating varied data sources into the prompt context is a key\nchallenge in developing applications like PomLink. POML addresses\nthis by providing components to reference diverse data types struc-\nturally and the flexibility to specify their processing and presen-\ntation to the LLM. For instance, the <document> component was\nused to embed content from user-selected text document files (e.g.,\nPDF documents). Attributes within this component allowed control\nover details like page selection or whether to preserve original for-\nmatting and embedded images. Similarly, the <table> component\ningested data from table files (e.g., Excel or CSV). This component\nallowed specifying input formats and ensured consistent rendering\nof table data (e.g., as Markdown or CSV) within the prompt. Figure 9\n(2) displays the user-facing options derived directly from POML’s\n<table> component capabilities for customizing data processing,\nsuch as toggling file name inclusion (Figure 9 (d)), incorporating\ncolumn descriptions, selecting rendering formats, and choosing\nbetween full or partial table rendering. Notably, the “Auto” table\nformat option (Figure 9 (e)) leverages findings from our TableQA\nstudy (§ 7.2) to automatically select the empirically determined\nbest format for the target LLM. Representing other data types like\nvoice memos (<audio>), web pages (<webpage>), images (<img>),\nor managing conversation history (<conversation>) was achieved\nstraightforwardly using POML’s unified framework for context\ndata aggregation."}

A functional prototype was completed byone\nof the POML development team in just 2 days . Around 90% of this time\nwas dedicated to iOS environment configuration, UI development,\nand simulator deployment, rather than core prompt engineering\ntasks. The application’s core logic required only 6 POML prompts : 1\ncommon system prompt, 4 task-specific prompts, and 1 prompt pro-\ncessing “ask-anything” queries, averaging a concise 35 lines of code\neach. This efficiency stems from POML’s ability to abstract complex\ndata handling. The built-in data components managed file parsing\nand formatting, eliminating the need for custom data processing\ncode typically required in traditional approaches. This allowed the\ndeveloper to focus primarily on the application’s logic and user\ninterface. Furthermore, prompt styling was managed effectively\nthrough POML’s internal styling system; presentation adjustments\n(e.g., captions, spacing, syntax) were made efficiently by modifying\nthe central stylesheet JSON (Figure 1 (c)), without altering the main\nprompt logic.\nThe development workflow for PomLink was significantly accel-\nerated by POML’s toolkit (§ 5), particularly the VSCode extension.\nWithin the PomLink project, the extension’s live preview (Figure 1\n(g)) provided immediate visual feedback on prompt rendering, in-\ncluding embedded document files (Figure 1 (h)), while integrated\ndiagnostics (Figure 1 (e)) instantly flagged errors, streamlining de-\nbugging. Hover documentation (Figure 1 (d)) and auto-completion\n(Figure 1 (f)) reduced the need to consult external references. The\ninteractive testing feature (Figure 7) allowed rapid iteration by en-\nabling direct LLM calls and response viewing within the editor,\nconsiderably shortening the debug cycle for PomLink’s prompts.\nIntegration into the PomLink application’s React Native backend\nwas achieved using the POML Node.js SDK (Figure 8 (a)), which\nhandled loading POML files, injecting dynamic data, and rendering\nthe final prompt string. The text-based, modular nature of POML\nprompts also integrated seamlessly with Git for version control\nwithin the project (Figure 1 (a)).\nIn summary, the PomLink case study validated POML’s effective-\nness as a practical tool for real-world LLM application development.\nIt demonstrated how POML’s features streamline development: its\nstructural markup (DG1), its data components (DG2), styling sys-\ntem (DG3), and development toolkit ( DG4) collectively enabled\nrapid prototyping and simplified the management of complex, multi-\nmodal prompts. The ability to create a versatile agent application\nprototype in just two days highlights POML’s potential to acceler-\nate innovation in developing sophisticated LLM-powered software\nby managing prompt structure and integration complexities effec-\ntively.\n7.2 TableQA – Deep Exploration of Prompt\nStyling\nPrior research indicates that the specific structure and format used\nto present information within a prompt can significantly influence\nLLM performance [73, 76, 89].

Overall, this TableQA case study\nunderscores the critical role of prompt styling in achieving optimal\nLLM performance, which POML addresses.\nA critical styling dimension for TableQA is the format used to\nrepresent the table data itself. Our results, summarized in Table 3,\nreveal diversity in the optimal table formats across different models,\nconsistent with previous findings [ 36, 103]. While some models\nperformed best with simple formats like CSV, others preferred\nstructured representations like HTML, XML, JSON, or Markdown\nvariants. This variation emphasizes the importance of tailoring\ntable representations to the target LLM for optimal performance.\nThese findings directly informed the development of our PomLink\napplication (§ 7.1). The “Auto” table format option within PomLink\nuses these results, automatically selecting the table syntax identified\nas optimal for the user’s chosen backend LLM based on this study."}

This study required only one sin-\ngle, concise base POML prompt (30 lines of code, see Appendix E).\nBy programmatically combining stylesheet variations, we gener-\nated a combinatorial search space encompassing 73,926 unique\nprompt style configurations derived from the single base POML file.\nUsing the POML Python SDK (§ 5.2), we loaded the base “.poml”\nfile and rendered final prompts by combining it with the generated\nstylesheets and the specific table/question data for each test case.\nBy enabling systematic variation and optimization of styling pa-\nrameters independently of the core prompt logic, POML provides a\nmechanism for adapting prompts to different LLM characteristics\nand maximizing performance through experimentation, reducing\nthe engineering effort compared to manually managing numerous\nprompt variations.\n8 User Study\nWe conducted a formal user study to evaluate the usability, effective-\nness, and developer experience of POML and its toolkit in practical\nscenarios. The study aimed to assess POML’s utility for representa-\ntive prompt engineering tasks and gather qualitative feedback to\nidentify its strengths and limitations.\nParticipants We recruited seven participants with diverse techni-\ncal backgrounds, including software engineers, researchers, and stu-\ndents.

Participant backgrounds, self-reported prompt\nengineering experience levels, and prior use of LLMs in applica-\ntion development are detailed in Table 4. This diversity was sought\nto gather feedback reflecting different potential user experiences\nand needs, especially regarding prior experience developing LLM-\nrelated applications.\nTasks We designed five distinct tasks of increasing complexity\nto probe different facets of POML’s capabilities.\n•Task 1 (T1) involved rewriting an existing plain text prompt\ninto POML and subsequently restyling its output presentation\nto YAML format using POML’s styling features.\n•Task 2 (T2) focused on utilizing POML’s document handling\nfeatures (<document>) to process TODO items embedded\nwithin a Microsoft Word document, showcasing its ability to\nintegrate and present document content effectively.\n•Task 3 (T3) required participants to analyze stock market\ndata (alongside its visualization) provided in an Excel spread-\nsheet (<table>) and prompt an LLM for investing recommen-\ndations, testing table integration and image presentation.\n•Task 4 (T4) explored meta-prompting concepts by asking\nparticipants to use an LLM (initially GPT-4o) to generate\nPOML code based on a list of POML examples; they were\nthen asked to adapt the prompt to target a smaller code-\ncompletion model, CodeGemma-2B [82], evaluating POML’s\nrole in managing prompts for different models and the per-\nceived difficulty of this adaptation.\n•Task 5 (T5) , the most complex task, involved translating\ncontent from two subtitle files (in TSV format, one from a 22-\nminute animation, the other from a 45-minute news report)\nwhile preserving specific formatting conventions and times-\ntamps, testing POML’s ability to read, process, and present\ntabular data subsets in specific formats under constraints.\nThe code and data associated with these tasks are available in\nthe supplementary material.\nProcedure Each participant engaged in a single session lasting\napproximately 90 minutes.

Participants recog-\nnized the value of format control (P1 found the format changing\nfeature “quite cool, ” a sentiment echoed by P7 regarding the value of\nformat control). They also praised its suitability for structured tasks\nlike format conversion. P5 described POML as “suitable for struc-\ntured work... especially for file format conversion. ”. While tasks\nwithin the study can often be resolved with inline attributes only\n(e.g., in T1, T3, T5), P2 successfully used an external <stylesheet>\nin T1, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach. However,\ndeeper engagement with complex stylesheets was limited by the\nstudy’s scope, leaving the full potential for systematic format man-\nagement largely recognized conceptually.\nDevelopment Experience The integrated development toolkit\nreceived predominantly positive feedback for enhancing the prompt\nauthoring workflow. The live preview feature was universally praised\nfor providing immediate visual feedback on the rendered prompt\nstructure, thereby reducing cognitive load and improving clarity (P1,\nP4). The integrated testing feature, particularly its real-time stream-\ning of LLM outputs, was also valued, with P6 finding the stream-\ning capability “surprisingly impressive. ” Participants frequently\nadopted an iterative edit-preview-test cycle within the IDE, con-\nsistent with common prompt engineering practices [102]. Usage\npatterns for IDE assistance features varied, as discussed in § 8.1.\nHover help was frequently used by some participants. For instance,\nP6 mentioned “frequently using the hover feature to explore avail-\nable documentation”. Auto-completion saw extensive use by others\n(e.g., P3, P4, P7), indicating active engagement with these assistance\ntools despite differing individual habits.\nLearning Curve Participants’ prior technical experience, particu-\nlarly familiarity with HTML/XML markup, significantly influenced\ntheir perceived learning curve. Those with relevant backgrounds\n(P2 found it “elegant like React”; P7 was “familiar with markup\nlanguages”) generally found the syntax intuitive. Conversely, par-\nticipants without such experience (P1 stated “I don’t know HTML\nvery well ... don’t know attributes need to be quoted”) reported a\nsteeper initial learning curve and relied more heavily on the live\npreview and provided documentation. P6 initially found the number\nof components somewhat “overwhelming. ” The provided documen-\ntation (video, examples, manual) served as crucial initial learning\nresources, frequently consulted by participants (especially P1, P3,\nP6). Despite varying adaptation speeds, all participants appeared to\ngain comfort with basic POML usage within 10–15 minutes of start-\ning their first task, aided by the IDE’s live preview and diagnostics.\nWorkflow Integration Participants described diverse existing\nstrategies for managing prompts, ranging from informal methods\nlike using note-taking applications (P1 stated “I currently manage\nmy prompts through OneNote”) or simple text files (P5), to embed-\nding prompts directly within application code (P2 mentioned “If I\nwrite in Python, I often write prompts messily [in Python string]”).\nDespite these varied habits, a majority (5 of 7) expressed potential\nfor integrating POML into their workflows, particularly for two\ntypes of use cases. First, for managing frequently used or complex\npersonal prompts , participants valued the organization POML pro-\nvides (P1 explained “if I put them in a [code] repo, I can find them, ”\ncontrasting with the disorganization of OneNote).

This approach facilitates standard version control practices\n(P2 and P6 explicitly mentioned “Git integration”) and improves\ncollaboration through shared, standardized prompt definitions (P6\nreflected that “it might be more conducive to my subsequent prompt\nmanagement”). Integration with Python, though not reflected in the\ngiven tasks, was frequently cited as critical for adoption in appli-\ncation development contexts (P1, P5, P6), as well as programmatic\nprompt generation and incorporation into existing AI/ML pipelines.\nEnvisioned Values Beyond the study tasks, participants envi-\nsioned several practical applications where POML’s structure and\ndata handling would be beneficial. P1 suggested using POML to\nmanage context for writing tasks by embedding related research\npapers as documents: “let it read several related works first... then\nlet it follow some instructions to write [my article]. ” P3 similarly\nsaw potential for academic writing support. P2 highlighted the con-\nvenience for table processing, stating that without POML, it “would\nrequire writing a lot of code and formatting... but with POML it\nwould be convenient, ” envisioning its use for “running benchmarks. ”\nUnexpected Usage Patterns and Desires Observations revealed\npotential use cases beyond POML’s primary design focus. Some\nparticipants (P1, P3, P6) appeared to use data components (e.g.,\n<document>) partly as a convenient way to preview file contents\nwithin the IDE, suggesting secondary value as an integrated data\nviewer. P3 appreciated how POML could “import a file directly,\nthen help me read it out, help me display it, ” Occasional comments\nalso hinted at a desire among some advanced users (P6, P7) for\nlower-level customization options regarding component rendering.\nInterest was also expressed in exploring agent-like capabilities by\nwriting multiple distinct prompts within a single.pomlfile, with P5\nsuggesting “potential for extending the framework towards more\ncomplex task orchestration. ”\nUsage Overhead The frequent use of intention and structural\ncomponents (Figure 11) suggests that most participants appreci-\nated the explicit structure POML imposes for managing prompt\ncomplexity in such scenarios. However, a trade-off regarding usage\noverhead was noted by several participants (P1, P4, P6). For simple,\none-off prompts, the explicit component structure could introduce\ntyping or cognitive overhead compared to plain text, described by\nP1 and echoed by P5 as potentially “using a sledgehammer to crack\na nut. ” While POML’s design attempts to minimize this for simple\ncases (e.g., the root <poml> tag is optional, as discussed in § 4.1),\nthe need to create a file and the mental burden caused by .poml\nsuffix still represents a higher initial cost than typing directly into\na chat interface. This feedback suggests POML’s value proposition\nis strongest for complex, data-intensive prompts where structure,\nlifecycle maintainability, and reusability are paramount, while it\nmay be overkill for simple, transient plain text prompts."}

Although POML’s strengths\nwere confirmed, the evaluation also highlighted areas for refine-\nment based on user feedback and task challenges. These findings\ninform this discussion on improvements, limitations, and future\ndirections.\n9.1 Suggestions for Improvement\nUsability and Developer Experience Improvements Partic-\nipants suggested several usability enhancements to improve the\nlearning curve and development workflow. A recurring request\nwas for more comprehensive documentation, including searchable\nreferences and practical examples covering advanced styling and\ntemplating (P2 asked for “documentation that’s easy to look up”).\nClearer, more actionable error messages were desired to expedite\ndebugging, as current messages were sometimes found opaque (P1\nand P3 stated “Error messages are hard to understand”). Language\nor tooling simplifications, such as sensible default attributes (P2) or\nclearer distinctions between similar components (P6), were also pro-\nposed. Performance optimization, particularly for large document\nhandling (P7) and code assistance responsiveness, remains crucial.\nRefining auto-completion accuracy (P7) and mitigating conflicts\nwith tools like GitHub Copilot (P2) were noted as important for a\nsmoother experience.\nFeature Requests User requests focused on enhancing work-\nflow integration and expanding POML’s functionality. Participants\ndesired options to directly save LLM test outputs to files (P6), bypass-\ning manual copying. Improved mechanisms for managing multi-\nturn conversations within the POML tool were commonly sought\nby almost all participants. Greater user control over LLM selection\nand API key management during testing was also requested (P3,\nP5). Support for additional document formats like LaTeX, particu-\nlarly for academic use cases (P3), was suggested. Some novice users\nindicated a desire for integrated guidance on prompt best practices\nor model-specific formatting (P1), reflecting known challenges in\nprompt engineering interfaces [102].\n9.2 Limitations\nAccessibility The current POML VSCode extension (especially\nthe live preview) presents significant accessibility barriers. It lacks\noptimization for users relying on assistive technologies like screen\nreaders or requiring high-contrast modes. Key areas needing im-\nprovement include keyboard navigability, text equivalents for UI\nelements, sufficient color contrast, and font size scaling support. Ad-\ndressing these gaps based on established guidelines [92] is essential\nto ensure broader usability.\nUser Study Our user study findings (§ 8) are subject to method-\nological limitations. The 90-minute sessions restricted deep explo-\nration of advanced features. The small participant sample (𝑁 = 7),\nthough diverse, consisted mainly of technical users, potentially\nlimiting generalizability. The controlled lab setting might not fully\nreflect real-world project complexities. Furthermore, most partici-\npants did not deeply engage with complex stylesheets during the\ntasks. To help mitigate these limitations, we are actively working\nto open-source POML on GitHub and release the extension on the\nVSCode Extension Marketplace, which will allow us to gather feed-\nback from a broader and more diverse audience using POML in\nreal-world contexts.\n9.3 Future Work\nBased on user feedback, case study insights, and identified limi-\ntations, future work will prioritize enhancing POML’s usability,\nfeatures, and ecosystem. We will keep improving the developer\nexperience through better accessibility support, augmented docu-\nmentation, refined error diagnostics, performance optimizations,\nand enhanced SDK usability.

Key feature developments include\nmore sophisticated multi-turn conversation management, flexible\noutput handling (e.g., direct file saving), and an expanded template\nlibrary, potentially incorporating model-specific styling insights\n(§ 7.2). The structured nature of POML also makes it suitable for\nexploring automated prompt engineering techniques [44, 48, 105],\nwhich is another promising direction for future research.\nBeyond core enhancements, we aim to promote POML adoption\nand demonstrate its value across various domains. We envision\nPOML as a general-purpose prompt markup language. Potential\napplications include serving as a meta-prompt language in agent\nsystems [50], a structured approach to configure applications like\nCursor [2], or a facilitator for industry-level LLM response evalu-\nation workflows as seen in tools like the Azure AI SDK [ 1]. Fur-\nther investigation into its utility in complex RAG pipelines, educa-\ntional tools, domain-specific component libraries, and collaborative\nprompt engineering environments is also warranted.\n10 Conclusion\nThis paper presented POML, a novel Prompt Markup Language\ndesigned to address critical challenges in contemporary prompt\nengineering. POML introduces a component-based structure for\nenhanced clarity and maintainability, specialized components for\neffective integration of diverse data types, and a decoupled styling\nsystem to systematically manage LLM format sensitivity. Comple-\nmenting the language, an integrated development toolkit, featuring\nIDE support and multi-language SDKs, aims to streamline prompt\nauthoring, testing, and management. The effectiveness and practi-\ncal utility of POML were empirically validated through two distinct\ncase studies alongside a formal user study assessing usability and\ndeveloper experience. Collectively, these contributions establish\nPOML as a structured, maintainable, and versatile paradigm that\naddresses prevalent prompt engineering difficulties, thereby en-\nhancing developer workflows, prompt reusability, and collaborative\nefforts in building sophisticated LLM applications.\nReferences\n[1] Azure AI. 2024.

Others, such as VSCode Prompt\nTSX [90], Priompt [8], Prxmpt [10], and MDXPrompt [30], focus on\nprompt authoring using JSX/TSX or MDX syntax, often integrating\nclosely with specific runtime environments (e.g., Node.js) or priori-\ntizing features like context length management via priority systems.\nSpecialized formats like ChatML [77] define role-based structures\nfor conversational history, while PromptML [68] proposes a custom\nDSL focused on intention components but currently lacks inte-\ngrated tooling. SAMMO [ 75] takes a distinct approach, using a\nPython API for programmatic manipulation and structure-aware\noptimization rather than direct markup authoring.\nIn contrast to these approaches, POML aims for a comprehensive,\nstandalone solution distinguished by several key characteristics\nevident in the comparison. It provides a language-agnostic runtime,\nenhancing portability compared to tools tied to Node.js or Python.\nPOML incorporates versatile components covering basic structure,\nintention expression, and data integration, offering arguably the\nmost extensive built-in support among the listed tools for diverse\ndata types like tables, documents, and webpages. POML also inte-\ngrates a unique CSS-like styling system for decoupling presentation\nfrom content and provides a full VS Code IDE extension, seeking\nto unify structure, data handling, styling, and development tooling\nwithin a single cohesive framework more completely than other\napproaches listed in Table 5.\nB Templating Engine Design Details\nTo support the creation of dynamic and data-driven prompts, POML\nintegrates a built-in templating engine. This capability is inspired\nby widely adopted templating systems in web development frame-\nworks [5, 29, 34, 40, 69, 85, 91] and common practices in existing\nprompting frameworks [3, 53]. Providing an integrated engine en-\nhances POML’s utility, particularly for scenarios where prompts\nneed to be generated dynamically based on runtime data with-\nout external scripting languages (DG2), contributing to efficient\ndevelopment workflows (DG4).\nThe engine allows for the insertion of variable values directly\ninto the prompt text using a familiar double curly brace syntax:\n{{variable}}. Its syntax for variables and control structures draws\ninspiration specifically from popular engines like Jinja and Handle-\nbars [34, 40]. These variables can represent contextual placeholders\nthat are populated at runtime from external data sources (e.g., docu-\nments, table records) or defined programmatically within the POML\ndocument itself using the<let>tag, enabling dynamic data binding\nand temporary variable assignment within the template logic.\nBeyond simple variable substitution, the templating engine sup-\nports essential control structures for generating complex prompt\nlogic dynamically. Iteration over data collections (like lists or ar-\nrays) is handled using a for attribute, allowing repetitive struc-\ntures to be generated concisely (e.g., <list><item for=\"file in\nfiles\">{{file.description}}</item></list> would create a\nlist item for each object in thefilescollection). Conditional render-\ning of prompt sections is achieved throughif/else-like constructs,\nenabling parts of the prompt to be included or excluded based on\nthe evaluation of variable values or logical expressions (e.g., condi-\ntionally including a detailed explanation section only if a verbose\nflag is set to true).\nThe inclusion of this integrated templating engine offers sev-\neral advantages for prompt engineering. It significantly reduces\nredundancy by allowing developers to define reusable prompt struc-"}

It significantly reduces\nredundancy by allowing developers to define reusable prompt struc-\ntures that can be populated with different data inputs, rather than\ncreating many similar static prompts. Compared to constructing\nprompts through manual string manipulation or concatenation in a\ngeneral-purpose programming language, which can be often error-\nprone and less readable [15], POML’s templating approach makes\nthe prompt structure more visually apparent and closer to a “What\nYou See Is What You Get” (WYSIWYG) experience, simplifying the\ndebugging process. The engine’s standalone capability provides\ndynamic prompting capabilities without mandating the use of an\nexternal programming language wrapper, differentiating POML\nfrom some other markup approaches that primarily serve as static\ndata formats [13, 30, 68].\nC Three-Pass Rendering Framework\nThe POML implementation employs a three-pass rendering frame-\nwork. This architecture processes the POML markup in three dis-\ntinct stages: first, a “Parser” pass transforms the input into React JSX\ncomponents; second, React processes these components to build\na comprehensive Intermediate Representation (IR); and third, a\n“Writer” pass converts this IR into the desired final output format\n(e.g., Markdown, JSON). The primary motivation for this three-pass\napproach is the clear separation of concerns. The first pass (Parser)\nfocuses exclusively on parsing the input markup, validating its\nstructure, applying templating, stylesheets, and transforming it\ninto React components. The second pass (React processing) focuses\non generating a detailed IR with complete metadata. The third pass\n(Writer) is solely responsible for traversing the validated IR and\nserializing it into a specific target format. This separation minimizes\ninterdependencies, ensuring that changes related to styling or data\nhandling do not inadvertently break the final rendering logic.\nThis three-tier separation fosters flexibility and extensibility.\nAdding support for new output formats only requires implement-\ning a new Writer module, without modifying the core parsing,\ntemplating, or styling logic. Feature additions are simplified as each\npass addresses a distinct, well-defined set of tasks. From a perfor-\nmance perspective, the generated IR can be cached and reused to\nproduce multiple output formats (e.g., generating both a plain text\nversion and a chat-structured version simultaneously) without in-\ncurring the cost of re-parsing the original POML source, which is\nparticularly beneficial for large prompts involving extensive data\ncomponents.\nThe first pass, executed by the Parser module, begins by pars-\ning the raw POML markup. It identifies all known POML tags (e.g.,\n<task>, <document>, <table>) and their attributes. The parser vali-\ndates the markup structure against the POML specification, flagging\nmalformed tags or invalid attributes, often with a degree of error\ntolerance to handle minor issues without halting processing entirely"}

Using React’s virtual DOM concept, this pass\nconstructs a comprehensive Intermediate Representation (IR) - an\nin-memory tree of structured nodes corresponding to the POML\nelements, their resolved content, computed styles, and extensive\nmetadata including original source positions and serialization hints.\nThis IR contains 21 distinct node types (Appendix D) and captures\nall information needed for the final rendering stage, creating a clean,\nvalidated representation ready for the third pass.\nThe third pass is handled by a selected Writer module. Its pur-\npose is to convert the structured Intermediate Representation (IR)"}

Based on the\ntype of the IR node and the target output format, the Writer seri-\nalizes the node’s content appropriately. For example, a listnode\nmight be rendered as a bulleted or numbered list in Markdown,\nwhile a tablenode could be formatted as CSV or a Markdown table\ndepending on the Writer’s configuration and the style attributes cap-\ntured in the IR. Furthermore, the Writer propagates and computes\nmetadata associated with each node, such as the “speaker” attribute.\nThis allows the Writer to structure the output appropriately for\ndifferent contexts, for instance, by splitting the final rendered text\ninto distinct sections based on the speaker (e.g., “human”, “system”)\nif required by the target format (like chat completion APIs).\nDifferent Writer modules can be implemented and selected to\nproduce various outputs from the exact same IR. This architecture\nmakes it straightforward to extend POML to support new target\nformats (e.g., LaTeX, specific API JSON schemas) by simply creating\na new Writer implementation without modifying the earlier passes.\nWriters are designed with error tolerance in mind. They can\nhandle partially formed IR nodes (if errors occurred during earlier\npasses but were tolerated) or missing data references that could\nnot be resolved. If configuration parameters specific to the writer\n(e.g., a required CSV delimiter) are missing or invalid, the writer\ntypically alerts the developer but attempts to continue converting\nthe parts of the IR that are unaffected.\nThis three-pass structure consistently maintains the separation\nof concerns between prompt logic/content and final presentation/layout.\nUpdates to data sources (srcattributes) or styling rules (<stylesheet>)\ncaptured during the earlier passes generally do not require any\nchanges to the Writer logic. This reinforces POML’s commitment\nto a modular and robust approach to prompt engineering, aligning\nwith design goals for Reusability ( DG1) and Style Management\n(DG3)."}

A promi-\nnent technique is self-consistency, which samples multiple reasoning paths and aggregates final\nanswers through majority voting (Wang et al., 2023). This type of approach, also known as parallel\nthinking, significantly improves reasoning accuracy but incurs substantial computational overhead:\ngenerating numerous reasoning traces per query scales inference overhead linearly, limiting prac-\ntical deployment (Xue et al., 2023). For example, improving pass@1 accuracy from 68% to 82%\nusing standard majority voting on AIME 2025 requires 511 additional reasoning traces per question\nusing Qwen3-8B, consuming 100 million additional tokens.\nMoreover, parallel thinking with majority voting exhibits diminishing returns—performance often\nsaturates or degrades as the number of traces increase (Chen et al., 2024a). A key limitation is\nthat standard majority voting treats all reasoning traces equally, ignoring quality variations (Pal\net al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025). This can lead to suboptimal performance when low-quality traces\ndominate the voting process.\nRecent work has leveraged next-token distribution statistics to assess reasoning trace quality (Geng\net al., 2024; Fadeeva et al., 2024; Kang et al., 2025). Higher prediction confidence typically cor-\nrelates with lower entropy and reduced uncertainty. By aggregating token-level statistics such as\nentropy and confidence scores, existing methods compute global confidence measures across an\nentire trace to identify and filter low-quality traces to improve majority voting performance (Kang\net al., 2025).\nHowever, global confidence measures present several limitations in practice. First, they may obscure\nconfidence fluctuations at local reasoning steps, which can provide sufficient signals for estimating\ntrace quality. Averaging across entire tokens in a trace can mask critical reasoning breakdowns\nthat occur at specific intermediate steps. Second, global confidence measures require generating\ncomplete reasoning traces before they can be calculated, which prevents early stopping of low-\nquality traces.\nWe introduce Deep Think with Confidence (DeepConf) , a simple yet effective test-time method\nthat combines parallel thinking with confidence-aware filtering, based on local confidence mea-\nsurements. DeepConf operates in both offline and online modes, identifying and discarding low-\nconfidence reasoning traces either during or after generation. This approach reduces unnecessary\ntoken generation while maintaining or improving final answer accuracy.\nWe evaluate DeepConf across multiple reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024/2025, HMMT 2025,\nBRUMO25, GPQA-Diamond) and models (DeepSeek-8B, Qwen3-8B/32B, GPT-OSS-20B/120B).\nThrough extensive experiments averaged across 64 repetitions per setting, we demonstrate that\nDeepConf achieves superior reasoning performance while requiring significantly fewer generated\ntokens compared to standard majority voting.\nIn offline mode with access to all reasoning traces, DeepConf@512 achieves 99.9% accuracy on\nAIME 2025 using GPT-OSS-120B (no tools), saturating this benchmark compared to 97.0% for\ncons@512 (majority voting) and 91.8% for pass@1. In online mode with real-time generation\ncontrol, DeepConf reduces token generation by up to 84.7% compared to standard parallel thinking\nwhile maintaining or exceeding accuracy. Fig. 1 highlights our key results.\n2 C ONFIDENCE AS AN INDICATOR OF REASONING QUALITY\nRecent work has demonstrated that reasoning trace quality can be effectively estimated using metrics\nderived from the model’s internal token distributions Kang et al. (2025). These metrics provide\nmodel-intrinsic signals for distinguishing high-quality reasoning trajectories from erroneous ones\nwithout requiring external supervision."}

We define token confidence Ci as the negative average log-probability of the\ntop-k tokens at position i:\nCi = −1\nk\nkX\nj=1\nlog Pi(j), (2)\nwhere k denotes the number of top tokens considered. High confidence corresponds to peaked distri-\nbutions and greater model certainty, while low confidence indicates uncertainty in token prediction.\nAverage Trace Confidence. Token-level metrics require aggregation to assess entire reasoning\ntraces. Following Kang et al. (2025), we employ average trace confidence (also termed self-\ncertainty) as a trace-level quality measure:\nCavg = 1\nN\nNX\ni=1\nCi, (3)\nwhere N is the total number of generated tokens. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, average trace con-\nfidence effectively distinguishes between correct and incorrect reasoning paths, with higher values\nindicating greater likelihood of correctness.\nDespite its effectiveness, average trace confidence has notable limitations. First, global aggregation\nobscures intermediate reasoning failures: a few high-confidence tokens can mask numerous low-\nconfidence segments, potentially hiding critical errors. Second, this approach requires complete\ntraces for quality assessment, preventing early termination of low-quality generations and resulting\nin computational inefficiency.\n3 D EEP THINK WITH CONFIDENCE\nIn this section, we present how to leverage confidence metrics more effectively to improve both\nreasoning performance and thinking efficiency. We target two primary scenarios: offline and online\nthinking. Offline thinking leverages confidence to enhance reasoning performance by evaluating and\naggregating information from completed reasoning traces. Online thinking incorporates confidence\nduring token generation to improve reasoning performance and/or computational efficiency in real-\ntime.\n3.1 C ONFIDENCE MEASUREMENTS\nTo address the limitations of global confidence measures like self-certainty, we introduce several\nalternative confidence measurements that capture local intermediate step quality and provide more\nfine-grained assessment of reasoning traces.\nGroup Confidence. We quantify the confidence of intermediate reasoning steps using group con-\nfidence. Group confidence provides a more localized and smoother signal by averaging token confi-\ndence over overlapping spans of the reasoning trace. Each token is associated with a sliding window\n3"}

To capture the effect of extremely low confidence groups, we\npropose bottom 10% group confidence , where trace confidence is determined by the mean of the\nbottom 10% of group confidences within the trace:\nCbottom-10(t) = 1\n|Gb|\nX\nGj∈Gb\nCGj , (5)\nwhere Gb is the set of groups with the lowest 10% confidence scores. Empirically, we find that 10%\neffectively captures the most problematic reasoning segments across different models and datasets.\nLowest Group Confidence. We also consider lowest group confidence, which represents the con-\nfidence of the least confident group within a reasoning trace—a special case of bottom 10% group\nconfidence. This measurement estimates trace quality based solely on the lowest confidence group:\nCleast(t) = min\nGj∈G\nCGj , (6)\nwhere G is the set of all token groups in the reasoning trace. We discuss how lowest group confidence\nimproves reasoning efficiency in online thinking scenarios.\nTail Confidence. Beyond group-based measurements, we proposetail confidence, which evaluates\nreasoning trace reliability by focusing on the final portion. This metric is motivated by observations\nthat reasoning quality often degrades toward the end of long chains of thought, and final steps are\ncritical for correct conclusions. In mathematical reasoning, final answer and conclusion steps are\nparticularly important: traces that start strong but end weakly may produce incorrect results despite\npromising intermediate reasoning. Tail confidence Ctail is defined as:\nCtail(t) = 1\n|Ttail|\nX\nt∈Ttail\nCt, (7)\nwhere Ttail represents a fixed number of tokens (e.g., 2048). Fig. 2 compares different confidence\nmeasurements, illustrating that both bottom 10% and tail confidence metrics better separate incorrect\nand correct trace distributions compared to mean confidence methods, suggesting these metrics are\nmore effective for trace quality estimation.\n3.2 O FFLINE THINKING WITH CONFIDENCE\nWe now describe how to apply various confidence measurements to improve reasoning performance\nin offline settings. In offline thinking, reasoning traces for each problem have been generated, and the\nkey challenge is aggregating information from multiple traces to better determine the final answer.\nWhile recent work proposes advanced methods for summarizing and analyzing reasoning traces\nusing LLMs, we focus on standard majority voting approaches.\nMajority Voting. In standard majority voting, the final answer from each reasoning trace con-\ntributes equally to the final decision. Let T be the set of all generated traces, and for each t ∈ T, let\nanswer(t) be the answer string extracted from trace t. The vote count for each candidate answer a\nis:\nV (a) =\nX\nt∈T\nI(answer(t) = a),\n4"}

Instead of treating each trace vote equally, we weight\neach final answer by the confidence of the associated trace. For every candidate answera, we define\nits total vote weight as:\nV (a) =\nX\nt∈T\nCt · I(answer(t) = a),\nwhere Ct is the trace-level confidence chosen from the confidence measurements discussed above.\nWe select the answer with the highest weighted vote. This voting scheme favors answers supported\nby high-confidence traces, thereby reducing the impact of uncertain or low-quality reasoning an-\nswers.\nConfidence Filtering. We apply confidence filtering in addition to weighted majority voting to\ncontrol concentration on high-confidence reasoning traces. Confidence filtering selects the top- η\npercent of traces based on trace confidence scores, ensuring only the most reliable paths contribute\nto the final answer. We provide two options across all confidence measurements: η = 10% and\nη = 90%.\nThe top 10% option focuses on highest confidence scores, suitable when few reliable traces are ex-\npected to yield accurate results. However, relying on very few traces risks incorrect answers if the\nmodel exhibits bias. The top 90% option offers a more balanced approach, maintaining diversity and\nreducing model bias by including a broader range of traces. This ensures alternative reasoning paths\nare considered, especially when confidence distributions tend to be uniform. Fig. 3 provides illus-\ntration for confidence measurements and how offline thinking works with confidence. In addition,\nAlg. 1 provides the details of the algorithm.\n3.3 O NLINE THINKING WITH CONFIDENCE\nEvaluating confidence during online thinking enables real-time estimation of trace quality during\ngeneration, allowing dynamic termination of unpromising traces. This approach is particularly valu-\nable in resource-constrained environments or when quick responses are necessary. The lowest group\nconfidence metric can be effectively applied in this online setting. We can halt trace generation\nwhen token group confidence falls below a critical threshold, ensuring such traces would likely be\nexcluded during confidence filtering.\n5"}

The approach in-\ncludes two main components: offline warmup and adaptive sampling.\nOffline Warmup. DeepConf requires an offline warmup phase to establish the stopping threshold\ns for online determination. For each new prompt, we generate Ninit reasoning traces (e.g., Ninit =\n16). The stopping threshold s is defined as:\ns = Percentile100−η({Ct : t ∈ Twarmup}),\nwhere Twarmup represents all warmup traces, Ct is the confidence of trace t, and η is the desired\nkeeping ratio. Specifically, DeepConf-low uses top η = 10% (corresponding to the 90th percentile)\nand DeepConf-high uses top η = 90% (corresponding to the 10th percentile) uniformly across\nall settings. This threshold ensures that during online generation, traces are terminated when their\nconfidence falls below the level that retains the top η% highest-confidence traces from the warmup\nphase.\nAdaptive Sampling. In DeepConf, we employ adaptive sampling across all methods to dynami-\ncally adjust the number of traces generated based on problem difficulty (Xue et al., 2023). Difficulty\nis assessed by consensus among generated traces, quantified by the ratio of majority vote weight\nV (ˆa) to total vote weight P\na V (a):\nβ = V (ˆa)P\na V (a).\nτ is a preset consensus threshold. If β < τ, the model does not reach consensus for the current prob-\nlem, and trace generation continues until a fixed trace budget B is met. Otherwise, trace generation\nhalts, finalizing the answer with existing traces.\nSince we use lowest group confidence, a sufficiently large warmup set yields an accurate estimate\nof the stopping threshold s; consequently, any trace terminated online has group confidence < s\nand would be excluded by the offline filter. Thus the online procedure approximates the offline\nlowest-group-confidence policy, with accuracy approaching offline accuracy asNinit increases (see\nAppendix B.2). We illustrate the online generation process in Fig. 4. In addition, Alg. 2 provides\nthe details of the algorithm.\n4 E XPERIMENTS\n4.1 E XPERIMENTAL SETUP\nModels.

We evaluate on five challenging datasets: AIME24 (Art of Problem Solving,\n2024a;b), AIME25 (Art of Problem Solving, 2025a;b), BRUMO25 (bru, 2025), HMMT25 (HMMT,\n2025), and GPQA (Rein et al., 2024). The first four are high-difficulty mathematical competition\nproblems, while GPQA comprises graduate-level STEM reasoning tasks. All benchmarks are widely\nadopted in recent evaluations of top reasoning LLMs (e.g., Grok-4 (xAI, 2025), Qwen3 (Yang et al.,\n2025a), GPT-5 (OpenAI, 2025)) and featured in the MathArena leaderboard (Balunovi´c et al., 2025).\nBaselines. We adopt self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023) with majority voting as our primary base-\nline. Each LLM samples T independent reasoning paths and selects the final answer via unweighted\nmajority voting, as formalized in Sec. 3.2.\nExperimental Settings. For each problem, we establish a common sampling frame by pre-\ngenerating a pool of 4,096 complete reasoning traces; this pool serves as the foundation for both\noffline and online evaluations. Offline experiments resample a working set of sizeK (e.g., K=512)\nfrom this pool on each run and apply the specified voting method. Online experiments similarly re-\nsample a working set to drive on-the-fly generation with early stopping; the pool ensures consistent\nsampling across methods.\nWe report four key methods: (i) Pass@1 (single-trace accuracy), (ii) Cons@K (unweighted majority-\nvote accuracy with K traces), (iii) Measure@K (confidence-weighted majority-vote accuracy), and\n(iv) Measure+top-η%@K, which retains the top η% traces by confidence within the sampled work-\ning set before applying weighted majority voting (we use η ∈ {10, 90}). The specific confidence\nmeasure varies by setting. We also report total generated tokens. All metrics are averaged over 64\nindependent runs with fresh resampling; unless noted, tokens are counted end-to-end for all gener-\nated traces, with early-terminated traces contributing only tokens produced before stopping.\nFor online evaluation, we instantiate DeepConf-low and DeepConf-high using Lowest Group Con-\nfidence (Eq. 6) with an overlapping window of 2,048 tokens. Each problem begins with Ninit=16\ncomplete traces for offline warmup; we then set a run-specific stopping threshold s = mint∈Ttop Ct,\n7"}

We\ncompare the following methods: Pass@1 = single-trace accuracy; Cons@512 = unweighted majority\nvoting with 512 traces; Mean Conf@512 = confidence-weighted majority voting using average trace\nconfidence (Eq. 3); Bottom-10% Conf@512 and Tail Conf@512 = confidence-weighted majority\nvoting using (i) the mean of the lowest 10% overlapping group confidences (Eq. 5) and (ii) the mean\nconfidence over the final 2,048 tokens (Eq. 7), respectively. The 90%/10% subcolumns indicate the\nretention ratio η in confidence filtering: we retain the top η% highest-confidence traces within the\nsampled working set before voting. For example, withK=512 and η=10%, we keep approximately\n51 traces for voting.\nOverall, confidence-aware weighting with filtering consistently outperforms standard majority vot-\ning (Cons@512) across most settings. Filtering with η=10% yields the largest gains, with no-\ntable improvements like DeepSeek-8B on AIME25 (82.3%→ 87.4%) and Qwen3-32B on AIME24\n(85.3% → 90.8%); GPT-OSS-120B even reaches 99.9% on AIME25. Both local (Tail Conf and\nBottom-10%) and global (Average Trace Conf) confidence measures show promising results in iden-\ntifying confident traces. However, filtering involves important trade-offs: while aggressive filtering\n(η=10%) maximizes accuracy gains in most cases, it can sometimes hurt performance due to model\noverconfidence on incorrect problems, as seen with GPT-OSS-120B. In such cases, conservative fil-\ntering (η=90%) provides a safer option. Substantial improvements over pass@1 are observed across\nall methods, confirming the value of ensemble approaches. We provide detailed confidence measure\ncomparisons in Appendix B.4.\n8"}

Fig. 5 reports offline results using\nLowest Group Confidence (Eq. 6) to capture the least-confident token group (window size 2,048)\nwithin each trace. Within each sampled working set we retain the top η% highest-confidence traces\nand then apply confidence-weighted majority voting. Across AIME24, AIME25, BRUMO25, and\nHMMT25 with DeepSeek-8B, retaining the top η=10% yields consistent gains over the best ac-\ncuracy achieved by majority voting: +0.26 to +9.38 percentage points (average +5.27), and large\nimprovements over single-trace (or no voting) accuracy ( +10.26 to +20.94 percentage points; aver-\nage +14.30). The conservative η=90% setting matches or slightly exceeds the best majority-voting\naccuracy on all four datasets ( +0.16 to +0.57 percentage points; average +0.29) while still provid-\ning substantial improvements over single-trace accuracy (average +9.31). These results motivate\nthe online variant: focusing on the least-confident segment reliably identifies traces with localized\nreasoning breakdowns, providing a strong signal for offline filtering and a natural stopping criterion\nduring online generation.\nBeyond these results, we ablate the retention rate η in Appendix B.3 and present the full offline\nresults in Appendix C.\n4.3 O NLINE EVALUATIONS\nIn this section, we evaluate accuracy-cost trade-offs of the online algorithm by varying the budget\nK ∈ {32, 64, 128, 256, 512}, where cost counts all generated tokens, including partial tokens from\nearly-stopped traces. Following Sec. 3.3, we perform a warm-up with Ninit=16 traces to set the\nstopping threshold s using Lowest Group Confidence (window size 2,048): we set s over the top-\nη% warm-up traces by confidence (η ∈{10, 90}) and then terminate any new trace once its current\ngroup confidence drops below s. After each new trace completes, we reapply the same threshold\ns for filtering so that the procedure matches the offline version of Lowest Group Confidence filter\nwhile saving the cost of early-stopped traces. We consider two online variants: DeepConf-low\n(η=10%) and DeepConf-high (η=90%), which continue sampling until the consensus ≥ τ (we use\nτ=0.95) or the budget cap K is reached. We compare with budget-only variants (always running to\ncap K without consensus stopping) and different τ values in Appendix B.1.\nTable 2 shows the performance of the adaptive sampling version of DeepConf at\nthe voting-size budget of K=512 on DeepSeek-8B/Qwen3-32B/GPT-OSS-120B. Compared\nwith the majority voting baseline, DeepConf-low reduces tokens by 43-79% across\nAIME24/AIME25/BRUMO25/HMMT25.

Along one axis, Chain-\nof-Thought (Wei et al., 2022) depth is scaled by lengthening a single reasoning trajectory through\nmore thinking steps; representative models include o1 (Jaech et al., 2024), DeepSeek R1 (Guo et al.,\n2025), Kimi K1.5 (Team et al., 2025), Qwen3 (Yang et al., 2025a), and Grok-4 (xAI, 2025), which\ntypically rely on large-scale RL with lots of samples, as well as simpler fine-tuning approaches\nsuch as STILL-2 Min et al. (2024), s1 Muennighoff et al. (2025), and LIMO Ye et al. (2025).\nAlong a complementary axis, parallel generation is scaled by increasing the number of trajectories\nand aggregating them: Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2023) and Best-of-N (Brown et al., 2024;\nIrvine et al., 2023) sample multiple candidates and select via voting or a score, while REBASE (Wu\net al., 2024) expands breadth with tree-structured exploration. Chen et al. (2024a) analyze parallel\ngeneration in compound AI systems. These two axes can be combined to trade compute for accuracy\nunder deployment constraints, and they underpin many recent reasoning-centric systems.\nA.2 E FFICIENT REASONING\nTest-time scaling for reasoning seeks better accuracy-compute trade-offs through adaptive sampling\nand richer aggregation. On the parallel axis, Early-Stopping Self-Consistency (ESC), Reasoning-\nAware Self-Consistency (RASC), Adaptive-Consistency, Dynamic V oting, and Dynasor achieve\nmore efficient self-consistency by reducing the required sample count while preserving accuracy (Li\net al., 2024; Wan et al., 2025; Aggarwal et al., 2023; Xue et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2024). On the\nCoT-depth axis, efficient CoT fine-tuning methods elicit shorter, more efficient chains (Chen et al.,\n2024b; Luo et al., 2025; Hou et al., 2025), whereas Dynasor-CoT (Fu et al., 2025) and DEER (Yang\net al., 2025b) optimize inference without additional training. Other works refine aggregation: ranked\nvoting (Wang et al., 2025) collects ranked candidate lists for more nuanced preference aggregation,\nlikelihood-weighted scoring (Soft-SC) (Wang et al., 2024) leverages model probabilities when no\nsingle answer dominates, and verification-augmented voting filters logically inconsistent paths using\nexternal tools (Toh et al., 2024). Complementarily, Hassid et al. (2025) show that preferring shorter\nCoT chains among multiple samples can improve accuracy. DeepConf leverages local confidence\nto improve accuracy by filtering out low-confidence traces; in online generation, it further performs\nearly termination when local confidence drops below threshold, reducing token usage.\nA.3 C ONFIDENCE ESTIMATION\nConfidence estimation techniques offer a complementary direction by directly quantifying the re-\nliability of model outputs. A growing body of work proposes metrics such as token-level en-\ntropy and uncertainty scores (Fadeeva et al., 2024), self-certainty based on KL divergence from\na uniform distribution (Kang et al., 2025), and specialized confidence tokens learned during fine-\ntuning (Chuang et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2025). In the same spirit, Dynasor (Fu et al., 2024) uses\nsemantic entropy (Farquhar et al., 2024) as a confidence signal. These signals have been applied to\nre-ranking (Jain et al., 2024), selective generation (Ren et al., 2023), and abstention in high-stakes\ndomains (Han et al., 2024), and they consistently exhibit better calibration than raw sequence prob-\nabilities (Geng et al., 2024).\nIntegrating confidence into test-time reasoning provides a way to assess the quality of individual\ntraces before aggregation. Recent results with global confidence, which is computed at the sequence\nlevel and applied post hoc to rank or select among completed candidates, show that combining"}

After generating Ninit=16\nwarmup traces, we check modal agreement before each new trace generation and stop generat-\ning more samples for this problem if the agreement exceeds τ. We evaluate on Qwen3-32B\nwith AIME24. τ=0.95 achieves optimal balance: it preserves accuracy exactly while saving\n15.4%/52.8% tokens at B = 32/512 (DeepConf-low) and 22.0%/54.7% (DeepConf-high). Conser-\nvative τ=1.0 weakens savings without accuracy drop. More aggressive thresholds ( τ=0.90, 0.85)\nincrease savings up to 69.6% but cause accuracy drops in DeepConf-low (e.g.,−0.26pp at τ=0.90),\nwhile DeepConf-high maintains perfect accuracy even at τ=0.85, showing greater robustness. Be-\ncause DeepConf-high already retains a larger pool of traces by design, changing τ has a smaller\ninfluence on the final vote. Besides, Token savings are larger at B = 512 than at B = 32 because\nadaptive stopping only applies after the Ninit = 16 warm-up traces. At B = 512 it can truncate up\nto the remaining 496 generations, whereas at B = 32 it can eliminate at most 16. As a result, the\nsame rate of early terminations translates into far greater relative token reductions at higher budgets.\nOverall, τ=0.95 offers the best tradeoff, cutting tokens by over half with zero accuracy loss.\nTable 3: Ablation on adaptive thresholds (Qwen3-32B @ AIME24). We report accuracy and token\nusage at voting budgets B ∈ {32, 512}.

On tokens, the net effect is driven by two forces:\n(i) a larger fixed warm-up cost because all Ninit traces run to completion and (ii) the post-warm-up\nearly-termination rate over the remaining B−Ninit traces. As these forces trade off, total token us-\nage is also not necessarily monotone in Ninit. Empirically, |∆Acc| across warm-up sizes is small\n(typically ≤ 1.0 p.p.). We therefore adopt Ninit=16 as a balanced default: sufficiently close to the\noffline baseline while avoiding excessive warm-up overhead.\nB.3 A BLATION ON FILTERING PERCENT .\nTable 5 investigates the effect of varying the keeping percentage for filtering method using Lowest\nGroup Confidence metric (group size 2,048).

The @ η% suffix indicates a filtering\nmechanism that retains only the topη% of traces ranked by confidence before applying the respective\nvoting method. For example, Mean@10% first selects the top 10% most confident traces and then\n18"}

By contrast, tail- and mean-based signals frequently yield gains. Notably, on DeepSeek-\n8B AIME25, a tail variant reaches 89.6% with only an 8B model, and on GPT-OSS-120B AIME25,\nTail(2k)@10% attains 99.9%.

In contrast, our method enables low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based\nonline reinforcement learning. We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),\nequipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past experiences are stored in an episodic\nmemory, either differentiable or non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental\nfeedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is achieved through efficient\nmemory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent model in the deep research setting, namelyMemento,\nwhich attains top-1 on GAIA validation (87.88% Pass@3) and79.40% on the test set. It reaches66.6% F1 and\n80.4% PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art training-based method, while\ncase-based memory adds4.7% to 9.6% absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a\nscalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of continuous, real-time learning\nwithout gradient updates, advancing machine learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research\nscenarios.

Introduction\nA Large Language Model (LLM) agent refers to a system that leverages one or more LLMs to autonomously\nperform complex tasks through interaction, reasoning, and decision making, often with access to external\ntools, memory, or environments (Christianos et al., 2023, Yang et al., 2025). Unlike passive LLMs that\nrespond to prompts in isolation, LLM agents operate proactively and iteratively, guided by explicit goals.\nThey are increasingly deployed as autonomous problem solvers (Choudhary et al., 2021, Wei et al., 2022,\nYao et al., 2023) spanning various domains. Notable examples include deep research agents (OpenAI, 2025,\nGoogle, 2025, ByteDance, 2025), tool-enhanced execution systems (Li et al., 2025c, Zheng et al., 2025, Qian\net al., 2025), and code generation agents (Cui et al., 2021, Guo et al., 2024, Grosnit et al., 2024, Guo et al.,\n2025), all of which demonstrate strong capabilities in complex scientific and engineering tasks.\nDespite recent progress, current LLM agents typically follow two prevailing paradigms, each exhibiting\nfundamental limitations. The first approach builds specialised frameworks with fixed workflows and hard-\ncoded reasoning, which work well for narrow tasks but lack flexibility. After deployment, such agents are\nstatic: they neither incorporate online information nor adapt to novel situations. The second paradigm\nfocuses on updating the LLM itself through parameter tuning of underlying LLMs – via supervised fine-tuning\nor reinforcement learning – which allows for more flexible behaviour (Christianos et al., 2023, Shi et al.,\n2025) but comes at a high computational cost. These approaches are inefficient for continuous adaptation\nand online learning, impractical for agents deployed in open-ended scenarios. This observation raises a\ncentral research challenge towards generalist agents:\nHow can we build LLM agents that learn continuously from a changing environment without the prohibitive cost\nof fine-tuning the underlying LLMs?\nInspired by human memory mechanisms, we address this challenge by proposing a memory-based learning\nframework that enables continual adaptation without modifying the underlying LLMs. We observe that\nhumans’ performance steadily improves because each experience is (i) encoded as an episodic trace (Pritzel\net al., 2017), (ii) distilled into abstract rules during sleep-dependent consolidation (Squire et al., 2015), (iii)\nselectively reinforced by dopamine-driven credit assignment (Glimcher, 2011), and (iv) retrieved through\ncase- or analogy-based reasoning when similar problems arise (Ashley, 1992). Thus, instead of fine-tuning\nthe base model, LLM agents leverage an external memory to store past trajectories – including successes\nand failures labels – and draw from similar past experiences to guide decision making. This approach aligns\nwith the principles of case-based reasoning (CBR) (Aamodt and Plaza, 1994, Guo et al., 2024, 2025), a\npsychologically grounded learning strategy supported by evidence that humans often solve problems by\nrecalling analogous past situations (Anderson, 2013, Ross, 1989). For example, in a deep research scenario,\ndeep research agents that have previously succeeded on a web-based task can leverage their experience to\nsolve never-seen and structurally similar tasks (Wiratunga et al., 2024).

We use a planner–executor\narchitecture with GPT-4.1 as the planner and o4-mini as the default executor (o3 for GAIA), instrumented with\ntools, namelyMemento. We achieve top-1 on GAIA validation (87.88% Pass@3) and79.40% on the private\ntest leaderboard, and it reaches66.6% F1 and 80.4% PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming\nthe state-of-the-art training-based system, while case-based memory adds4.7 to 9.6 absolute points on\nout-of-distribution tasks and yields95.0% PM on SimpleQA. To our knowledge, we are the first to cast\ncase-based continual learning for LLM agents, achieving the top-level performance on the GAIA benchmark,\nthereby providing a principled framework for continual adaptation of Deep Research agents.\n2. Related Work\nWe first review methods that equip LLMs with continual-learning capabilities. Then, we discuss approaches\nthat augment agents with external tools and multi-agent coordination. Lastly, we introduce agent memory\nmechanisms, characterising design choices in representation, retrieval, and decay, and their implications for\ncontinual learning.\n2.1. Continual-learning in LLM Agent Systems\nContinual-learningstrategiesforLLMagentscanbecategorisedintotwocamps. Parametricapproaches (Zhu\net al., 2025b,a) update the LLM through post-training (e.g., Reinforcement Learning (Wang et al., 2025))\nor supervised fine-tuning (e.g., START (Li et al., 2025a)), achieving high task fidelity at the expense of\nconsiderable compute, data, and the danger of catastrophic forgetting (Li et al., 2024). It is often assumed\nthat achieving the capability to solve complex reasoning problems requires substantial changes to the model’s\nparameters, and therefore, full fine-tuning is widely applied during RL (Liu et al., 2025). However, when\ntackling long-horizon, complex tasks (Mialon et al., 2023, Phan et al., 2025), LLM agent systems must\nspend substantial time rolling out trajectories to gather training data, and they additionally depend on\nlarge volumes of human-annotated questions. Differently,non-parametric approachesfreeze the LLM\nand attach an external memory to optimise the prompt construction process. Human intelligence relies\nheavily on memory systems, especially episodic memory, which supports learning from both successes and\nfailures (Baddeley, 1983). Cognitive science suggests that such memories are segmented and selectively\nreplayed to inform future decisions (Anderson et al., 1997, Khosla et al., 2023, Fountas et al., 2024). This\ninspired early AI paradigms like Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) (Francis and Ram, 1993). While modern\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems (Lewis et al., 2020) share surface similarities with CBR, they\ntypically query static document corpora and lack mechanisms for continual adaptation (Gao et al., 2023).\n2.2. Tool-augmented LLM\nLanguage agents increasingly incorporate external tools to overcome context limitations and computational\nbottlenecks. Prompt-based methods, including WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), embed tool calls directly in\nthe generation trace. However, tackling long-horizon tasks often requires multi-hop tool calls. Therefore,\nrecent works propose multi-agent pipelines, such as AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023), OWL (Camel-AI, 2025) and\nDeerFlow (ByteDance, 2025) to coordinate specialised agents via dialogue. To address long-horizon decision-\n3"}

This approach shifts LLM training from static\ntask-solving (e.g., math or code) to dynamic, agent–environment reasoning. Supervised Fine-tuning methods,\nincluding Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023), API-Bench (Li et al., 2023), and GRPO-based optimisation (Wang\net al., 2025, Qian et al., 2025, Feng et al., 2025) teach models when and how to invoke APIs, but require\ncostly retraining and often assume a fixed, small toolset (e.g., Code and Search). However, without explicit\nplanning, deciding when and which tools to invoke remains a major bottleneck for long-horizon tasks. We\nmodel planning as a stateful MDP with explicit memory for past cases. By bringing case-based reasoning into\nplanning, the executor is steered toward strategic tool calls and consistently strong performance.\n2.3. Agent Memory Mechanism\nRecent work has centred on endowing LLM agents with explicit memory structures. A growing body of\nwork (Camel-AI, 2025, Liang et al., 2025, Google, 2025, ByteDance, 2025) has shown that current LLM\nagents are designed for fixed environments, limiting their ability to evolve. While some efforts, such as\nReAct-style agents and reflective prompting pipelines (Shinn et al., 2023, Yao et al., 2023) demonstrate\nimprovement through feedback, they remain constrained by pre-defined heuristics and do not achieve true\nlifelong learning. DS-Agent (Guo et al., 2024) stabilises planning by mining prior Kaggle solutions and\nturning them into executable pipelines. Agent-K (Grosnit et al., 2024) adds structured memory and credit\nassignment to reuse past work, enabling end-to-end automation of Kaggle-style workflows. Furthermore,\nAgent-KB (Tang et al., 2025) and Alita (Qiu et al., 2025) construct shared knowledge bases and optimised\ntoolsets for agentic problem-solving. However, most systems keep adding cases without selective curation,\nleading to the classic swamping problem where retrieval costs outweigh utility (Francis and Ram, 1993).\nLLM agents are increasingly equipped with long-term memory that grows and adapts over time, allowing\nthem to accumulate knowledge, recall prior context, and adjust behaviour based on experience. Memory-\nBank (Zhong et al., 2024) couples retrieval with an Ebbinghaus-style forgetting schedule so older, low-utility\nitems decay while user-relevant facts are reinforced. Building on this idea, SAGE (Liang et al., 2024) unifies\nreflectionwithanEbbinghaus-basedmemoryoptimisertosupportcontinualself-refinement. Mem0(Chhikara\net al., 2025) adopts a structured memory mechanism with explicit operations (ADD, UPDATE, DELETE,\nNOOP). A-MEM (Xu et al., 2025) maintains memory via a typological network. MemInsight (Salama et al.,\n2025) pushes further on semantics by augmenting raw memories with summaries and tags to aid retrieval.\nSeveral lines of work distil operational knowledge from interaction traces: ExpeL (Zhao et al., 2024) collects\ntrajectories and converts them into reusable natural-language insights and rules; AutoGuide (Fu et al.,\n2024) compresses offline logs into concise, conditional, context-aware guidelines; and Agent Workflow Mem-\nory (Wang et al., 2024) induces frequently used subtask sequences as auxiliary skills. Finally, Agent-KB (Tang\net al., 2025) and Alita (Qiu et al., 2025) construct shared knowledge bases and optimised toolsets to support\nagentic problem solving. Differently, we formulate planning as a memory-augmented MDP and learn a neural\ncase-selection policy over an episodic case bank via online soft Q-learning, enabling continual adaptation\nwithout fine-tuning the underlying LLM parameters.\n3.

To begin with, we model the sequential decision-making process of CBR agents as a\nMemory-Based Markov Decision Process (M-MDP) as below.\nDefinition 3.1(Memory-Based Markov Decision Process). A Memory-Based Markov Decision Process is a\ntuple ⟨𝒮, 𝒜, 𝒫, ℛ, γ, ℳ⟩, where𝒮 is the state space,𝒜 is the action space,𝒫 ∶𝒮 ×𝒜 → ∆(𝒮) is the transition\ndynamics, ℛ ∶𝒮 ×𝒜 → R is the reward function,γ ∈[0, 1) is the discount factor, andℳ =(𝒮 ×𝒜 ×R)∗ is\nthe memory space.\nThe graphical model of M-MDP is illustrated in Figure 2. Note that the key difference from standard MDP is\nthat we introduce a memory space as a set of past experiences. In the CBR agent setting, both state space\nand action space are defined as the set of all finite-length sequences over a predefined vocabulary𝒱.\nWith the M-MDP formulation, the behaviour of the CBR agent can be formally described as follows. At\ntimestep t, we maintain a case bank (i.e., the memory)Mt ={ci}Nt\ni=1, with each caseci a tuple(si, ai, ri), and\nNt the number of cases in the current case bank. Given the current statest, the CBR agent first retrieves a\ncase ct ∼µ(⋅∣ st, Mt), and then reuses and adapts it via the LLM, i.e.,at ∼ pLLM(⋅∣ st, ct). Here,µ denotes\nthe case retrieval policy, whose implementation details will be presented later. Taking the actionat, the CBR\nagent receives the rewardrt =ℛ(st, at) and observes the next statest+1 ∼𝒫(⋅∣st, at). The CBR agent also\nretains the new case in the case bank, i.e.,Mt+1 = Mt ∪{(st, at, rt)}. In this way, we can define the overall\npolicy of the CBR agent as below.\nDefinition 3.2(Case-Based Reasoning Agent). A Case-Based Reasoning Agent is an agent that makes decisions\nbased on both the current state and a finite memory of past experiences. Formally, lets ∈𝒮 denote the current\nstate; M ∈ℳ denote the current case bank, consisting of past casesc; a ∈𝒜 denote the action;µ(c ∣ s, M)\ndenote a case retrieval policy, assigning a probability distribution overM given the current states; pLLM(a ∣ s, c)\ndenote the action likelihood of a large language model (LLM) conditioned on the current states and a retrieved\ncase c ∈ M. Then, the overall policyπ of a CBR agent is defined as:\nπ(a∣s, M) = ∑\nc∈M\nµ(c∣s, M)pLLM(a∣s, c). (1)\nOverall, the trajectoryτ of the CBR agent can be described as:τ ={M0, s0, c0, a0, r0, M1, s1, c1, a1, r1, ⋯}. The\n5"}

In this context, the \"action\" ofµ is to select a casec =(s, a, r)\nfrom the case bankM. To optimise it while encouraging diversity in retrieved cases, we apply the maximum\nentropy RL framework (Haarnoja et al., 2018) and derive the following optimisation objective:\nJ(π) =Eτ∼p [\nT−1\n∑\nt=0\n[ℛ(st, at)+αℋ(µ (⋅∣st, Mt))]], (3)\nwhere ℋ denotes the entropy, andα denotes the hyper-parameter of the entropy weight in the final reward.\nUnder this framework, the value function can be defined as:\nVπ(st, Mt) = ∑\nc∈Mt\nµ(c∣st, Mt)[Qπ(st, Mt, c)−α log µ(c∣st, Mt)]. (4)\nAlso, the Q value function for taking an \"action\" (i.e., selecting a case), given a state, can be defined as:\nQπ(st, Mt, ct) =Ea∼pLLM(⋅∣st,ct),st+1∼𝒫(⋅∣st,at) [ℛ(st, at)+γVπ(st+1, Mt+1)], (5)\nwhere Mt+1 denotes the updated memory after(st, at, rt) is added. Letdπ(s, M) =∑∞\nt=0 γt−1P(st =s, Mt =\nM) denote the discounted visitation frequency of(s, M) under π. The expected value function objective is\nthen defined as:\nJ(π) =E(s,M)∼dπ [Vπ(s, M)] =E(s,M)∼dπ [∑\nc∈M\nµ(c∣s, M)[Qπ(s, M, c)−α log µ(c∣s, M)]]. (6)\nThen, we can derive the closed-form solution of the optimal retrieval policy as a softmax over the optimal Q\nvalue:\nµ∗(c∣s, M) = exp(Q∗(s, M, c)/α)\n∑c′∈M exp(Q∗(s, M, c′)/α). (7)\nThe detailed derivation can be found in Appendix A. In this way, we can derive the optimal retrieval policy by\nlearning the Q-functionQ, which can be achieved by the temporal difference (TD) learning in soft Q-learning\n(Haarnoja et al., 2017) as:\nQ(st, Mt, ct) ← Q(st, Mt, ct)+η\n⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣\nrt +γα log ∑\nc′∈Mt+1\nexp (Q(st+1, Mt+1, ct+1))−Q(st, Mt, ct)\n⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦\n, (8)\nwhere η denotes the learning rate. Next, we provide a simpler way to learn the Q-function by learning a\nsimilarity kernel over states.\n6"}

Specifically, we\nmaintain an episodic memory𝒟 ={(s, c, Q)}, including the state, the retrieved case, and the Q value of each\ninteraction.

The planner is\nan LLM-based CBR agent enhanced by a Case Memory module that supports both Write, which records new cases\nand online refines the Q-function, and Read, which retrieves cases via the learned retrieval policy for adaptive case\nselection. The executor is an LLM-based MCP client that invokes external tools hosted on the MCP servers through the\nMCP protocol.\n4. Implementation: Deep Research Agent\nWe implement stateful prompt engineering via M-MDP methodology (§ 3) in Deep Research scenarios (Huang\net al., 2025), where agents must solve complex, long-horizon tasks by iteratively interacting with their\nenvironment, invoking external tools, retrieving information from external sources, and processing heteroge-\nneous data for dynamic reasoning. As illustrated in Figure 3,Memento alternates between two core stages:\nCase-Based Planning and Tool-Based Execution.\n4.1. Framework\nTo address the challenges of long-horizon reasoning,Memento follows the plan-and-act paradigm (Erdogan\net al., 2025), where the planner and executor operate in an alternating loop to iteratively advance task\ncompletion. For effective coordination,Memento integrates three memory modules:Case Memory (vectorised\nstorage of prior cases for high-level planning), Subtask Memory (text-based storage of active subtasks and\ntheir results), and Tool Memory (text-based logs of tool interactions for each subtask).\nIn the planning stage, Planner, instantiated as an LLM-driven CBR agent, receives the task instruction\nand queries the case memory for relevant case triplets(si, ai, ri)K\ni=1, wheresi is the task,ai is the plan,ri\nindicates success, andK is the retrieval count. This process is supported by a Case Memory module, which\nretrieves relevant experiences from a case bank through either a similarity-based retriever or online-updating\nQ-function, thus enabling the planner to leverage both parametric and non-parametric memory as priors.\nThe retrieved cases are concatenated with the current task instruction to form the prompt, guiding the\nLLM to generate a plan for each subtask. Once the initial task is decomposed, a Subtask Memory module\norchestrates the interaction between the planner and executor, recording generated subtasks and their\nexecution outcomes. After each iteration, the planner uses the accumulated execution history to assess task\n8"}

If the task is unfinished, the planner replans based on updated context; otherwise, the final\nresult is returned, and the case memory is updated with new experiences only upon task completion.\nThe execution stage is managed by an Executor, powered by a general-purpose LLM, which is responsible for\nexecuting each subtask as an autonomous episode (Sumers et al., 2023) using the MCP protocol. Unlike\nprior agents (Zheng et al., 2025, Weng et al., 2025),Memento’s executor supports rich reasoning and flexible\ntool composition. For each subtask, the executor consults the tool memory, determines the appropriate tool\ninvocation, and updates the results.which operates as a Model Context Protocol (MCP)1 client. The executor\nreads pending subtasks from the subtask memory, accesses relevant history from a Tool Memory (scoped per\nsubtask), and determines whether to invoke an external tool or return a result. MCP serves as a standardised,\nmodel-agnostic interface, enabling flexible coordination with diverse external tools and data sources. By\nunifying access under a single protocol layer,Memento can seamlessly integrate dynamic reasoning and\ncompositional tool use across multiple domains.\n4.2. Case Memory Management\nThe case memory is an online-growing case bankMt operated with Write and Read operations, available in\nnon-parametric and parametric variants. In the non-parametric setting, Write simply appends(st, at, rt), and\nRead retrieves cases by similarity for computational efficiency. In the parametric setting, Write further online\nupdates a Q-function to shape the retrieval distribution, while Read is driven by the learned Q-function,\nthereby realising adaptive case selection. More details are provided in Appendix B.\nMemory Storage.Following the CBR agent in Definition 3.2, the Write operation appends each historical\ncase (st, at, rt) to the case bankMt, after each time stept:\nWrite(st, at, rt, Mt) = Mt+1 = Mt ∪{(st, at, rt)}. (12)\nIn this process, the statest is encoded using a frozen text encoder, while the actionat and rewardrt are\npreserved in their original forms, as only the state representation requires vectorisation for subsequent\nretrieval operations. This Write operation is continuously performed throughout the agent’s execution,\nallowing the case bank to grow into a comprehensive and transferable repository of experiences incrementally.\nBy accumulating both successes and failures, the memory not only enables retrospective analysis for informed\navoidance of past mistakes but also provides successful trajectories that prospectively guide future planning.\nNon-Parametric Memory Retrieval.A cornerstone ofMemento is its dynamically evolving Case Bank, which\nunderpins its continual learning capability. At each planning step, this non-parametric memory module\nreceives the task instruction and then retrieves relevant cases, comprising a mixture of successful and failed\ncases. This CBR method mirrors human analogical learning, where previously encountered outcomes shape\ndecision-making (Aamodt and Plaza, 1994). Specifically, we retrieve theK nearest past cases from the case\nbank by computing the semantic similarity between the current state and past states. This design follows the\nmainstream CBR paradigm, which assumes that similar problems should have similar solutions (Wiratunga\net al., 2024, Guo et al., 2025), thereby allowing the agent to prioritise cases whose historical contexts are\nmost aligned with the current task. Formally, the Read operator of the non-parametric memory is defined as:\nReadNP(st, Mt) = TopK\n(si,ai,ri)∈Mt\nsim (enc(st), enc(si)), (13)\n1https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol\n9"}

Here,enc(⋅) represents the\npretrained textual encoder andsim(⋅) denotes the cosine similarity function.\nParametric Memory Retrieval.To empower the agent to selectively leverage high-utility cases to augment\nplanning from past experiences, we design a differential memory mechanism inMemento via a parametric\nQ-function. When writing new cases to the case bank, the parametric method, in contrast to the non-\nparametric approach that merely appends the tuple as in Eq.(12), concurrently updates the Q-function\nonline. Meanwhile, with CBR applied only for planning inMemento, the CBR planner can be simplified\nto a single-step setting instead of a multi-step M-MDP. This single-step setting collapses the TD target in\nEq. (10) to the immediate reward, thereby simplifying the learning objective. Without bootstrapping, the\nupdating reduces to a supervised learning paradigm, which avoids non-stationary targets. Therefore, we can\ntrain a parametric Q-functionQ(s, c; θ) end-to-end, dispensing with the kernel-based estimation in Eq.(9).\nAccordingly, the single-step Q-learning loss can be formulated as:\nℒ(θ) =E(s,c,r) [(Q(s, c; θ)−r)2], (14)\nwhere the tuple{(s, c, r)} is stored in the replay bufferℬ and Q is implemented as a neural network. Noting\nthat the reward signal in deep research tasks is binary (r ∈{0, 1}), we replace the Mean Squared Error (MSE)\nobjective with a cross-entropy (CE) loss, since MSE loss suffers from vanishing gradients near 0/1, whereas\nCE loss provides more numerically stable signals. Thus, we reformulate the training objective as a binary\nclassification loss:\nℒ(θ) =E(s,c,r) [−r log Q(s, c; θ)−(1 −r)log (1 −Q(s, c; θ))], (15)\nwhere Q can be seen as a normalised value representing the probabilityp(r =1∣s, c; θ), i.e., the likelihood\nthat the retrieved casec is a good reference for the current states given the case bankM. Unlike the\nnon-parametric approach that only preserves new cases, the parametric memory also refines the Q-function\nduring Write, enabling each update to both record a new case and update the overall Q-value landscape.\nDuring retrieval, the learned Q-function is used to compute the retrieval policy distribution via Eq.(7), from\nwhich cases can be sampled. To reduce the randomness of case selection and enhance the interpretability of\nthe agent’s decision process, the Read operation of the parametric memory applies aTopKoperator to select\nthe K cases with the highest Q-values, which are used as planning references:\nReadP(st, Mt) =TopK\nci ∈Mt\nQ(st, ci; θ). (16)\nBy continually updating the Q-function with new samples, the parametric memory module learns to capture\nthe latent patterns between states and cases, thereby producing a closer approximation to the underlying\ndistribution of the case retrieval policyµ∗.\n4.3. Tool Usage\nBesides the inherent requirement for long task execution sequences and multi-turn interactions, deep research\ntasks also place stringent demands on the atomic actions, which require the agent to be able to acquire\nexternal information and subsequently process, integrate, and analyse it. Thus, we design a suite of tools\nfor Memento accessible via the MCP protocol, comprising modules for information retrieval such as search\nengines and web crawlers, as well as components for processing and analysing multimodal information,\nincluding video and image data, and files in various formats.\n10"}

The results of\nprompt-based and training-based methods using Qwen2.5 (7B) are referred toDeepResearcher (Zheng et al., 2025).\n5.1. Datasets\nTo evaluate the general-purpose reasoning capabilities ofMemento, we adopt the GAIA benchmark (Mialon\net al., 2023), which comprises 450 non-trivial questions with unambiguous answers – 300 in the test set and\n150 in the validation set. Each question requires varying levels of tool use and autonomous planning, and the\ndataset is stratified into three difficulty levels: Level 1: Requires approximately 5 steps using a single tool;\nLevel 2: Requires 5–10 steps involving multiple tools; Level 3: Involves up to 50 steps with no restrictions on\nthe number or type of tools. Each level includes a public validation split and a private test split with hidden\nground-truth answers and metadata.\nWe further evaluateMemento on broader benchmarks compiled in DeepResearcher (Zheng et al., 2025),\nwhich draws from seven open-domain QA datasets: Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019),\nTriviaQA (TQ) (Joshi et al., 2017), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), 2Wiki (Ho et al., 2020), MusiQue (Trivedi\net al., 2022), Bamboogle (Press et al., 2022), and PopQA (Mallen et al., 2022). Each dataset contributes 512\nexamples, except Bamboogle, which provides 125 high-quality samples curated to minimise contamination\nand emphasise web-based synthesis.\nAdditionally, we include two challenging benchmarks: 1) SimpleQA (Wei et al., 2024), consisting of 4,330\nfact-seeking questions, focuses on factual accuracy. 2) Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE) (Phan et al., 2025),\nwith 2,500 questions across diverse academic subjects, assesses the limits of broad-domain reasoning.\n5.2. Evaluation Metrics\nAs each GAIA query has a single reference answer, we follow the GAIA leaderboard and use the Exact Match\n(EM) metric, which marks a prediction as correct only if it exactly matches the ground-truth answer after\nstandard normalisation (lowercasing, punctuation and article removal, whitespace normalisation).

We utilise GPT-4o-mini as the answer evaluator to give the scores and the prompt\nthe same as DeepResearcher (Zheng et al., 2025).\n5.3. Model Configurations\nThe Planner is powered byGPT-4.1, the Executor byo3 for GAIA ando4-mini for other datasets, the\nimage processing byGPT-4o, the video agent byGemini 2.5 Pro and the audio agent byAssembly AI.\nFor the non-parametric CBR, we encode sentences withSimCSE and rank candidate cases using cosine\nsimilarity. For the parametric CBR, we initialise sentence representations withSimCSE and implement the\nQ-function as a two-layer MLP to assign the Q value. Meanwhile, the CBR planner’s state at each step often\ncontains information inherited from previous states. To avoid redundant storage, only the state, action, and\nreward from the final step of each trajectory are written to memory, ensuring that the case bank remains\nboth compact and informative.\nThe Offline Executor setting refers to one static executor, removing the planner, case memory, and all\nexternal tools, so it reflects only raw parametric knowledge from LLMs. The Online Executor starts from\nthat stripped-down baseline but reconnects the same executor to live search and other MCP tools, reflecting\nthe value of real-time retrieval and tool execution.Memento (w/o CBR) keeps episodic memory disabled,\nallowing us to measure the extra gain delivered specifically by case-based reasoning.\n5.4. Experimental Results\nDeep Researcher.We include this dataset to test real-time web research, evidence retrieval, cross-page\nsynthesis, and multi-hop reasoning. As shown in Table 1,Memento augmented with MCP tools (e.g., search\nengine, browser) reaches an average66.6% F1 across the seven DeepResearcher benchmarks, nearly doubling\nthe 37.7% F1 of the CoT + RAG baseline.

To assess robustness in long-horizon planning, tool orchestration, and execution,\nwe employ the GAIA benchmark.Memento attains the top-1 ranking on the validation set and4th place\non the test set, outperforming most existing agent frameworks (Table 2). Notably, it surpasses widely used\nopen-source frameworks, including Manus (Liang et al., 2025), Aworld (Alibaba, 2025), and OWL (Camel-AI,\n2025), on both validation and test sets.\nFor the GAIA validation evaluation, we initialise memory from scratch and iteratively store both successful\nand failed trajectories in the case bank over three iterations. Using GPT-4.1 as the planner and o3 as the\nexecutor,Memento achieves 87.88% accuracy on the validation set. For the GAIA test set, performance is\nbased solely on the case bank accumulated during validation, yielding an accuracy of79.40%. Although\nMemento demonstrates strong overall performance, challenges remain for Level 3 tasks that require extended\nreasoning horizons and advanced tool coordination.\nHumanity’s Last Exam (HLE).To evaluate the frontier of human knowledge and the complex reasoning\nability in long-tail, specialised domains, we include the HLE9. Using our planner executor architecture, with\nplanner GPT-4.1 and executor o4-mini with tools,Memento attains 24.4% PM, ranking second overall and\nwithin 0.92 points of GPT-5 at 25.32%, while outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro at21.64%, o3-high at20.32%, and\no4-mini-high at18.08%. These results demonstrate that continual learning through CBR effectively transforms\nepisodic experiences into reusable knowledge, offering a complementary pathway to generalisation even in\nlong-tail domains where conventional tool usage and retrieval methods struggle.\nSimpleQA. To evaluateMemento’s reliability and robustness against hallucination in single-hop factual\nquestion answering, we employ the SimpleQA benchmark. As illustrated in Figure 4,Memento, implemented\nwith a planner–executor framework (GPT-4.1 as the planner and o4-mini as the executor) augmented\nwith tool use, achieves the highest accuracy among all baselines. Specifically, it reaches an accuracy of\n9https://scale.com/leaderboard/humanitys_last_exam\n14"}

Hyper-parameter Selection\nIncreasing the number of retrieved cases in CBR raises computational cost and can introduce noise from\nirrelevant examples.

This suggests that CBR benefits from a small, high-quality memory, unlike\nfew-shot prompting, where more examples often help (Agarwal et al., 2024). Careful case selection and\nmemory curation are thus crucial for continual learning.\n5.5.2.

More importantly, we observe a learning curve of the accuracy\non the DeepResearcher dataset with increased iterations, suggesting that memory-based approaches can\neffectively enhance LLM agents without requiring parameter updates.\nAlthough we attempted to locate any performance drops along the learning curve, in practice, such inflexion\npoints are elusive. With only about3k training data, the Case Bank saturates quickly. Each additional\niteration, therefore, contains progressively fewer previously unseen (and thus potentially failing) cases. In\nour simulated, open-ended, but ultimately finite environment, we observe rapid convergence with only\nmarginal gains after a few iterations. Consequently, adding many more iterations yields diminishing returns\nand contributes little to our understanding of memory-based continual learning.\n5.5.4. Generalisation across Tasks\nTo assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation, we follow the evaluation protocol of Zheng et al. (2025).\nSpecifically, MusiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022), Bamboogle (Press et al., 2022), and PopQA (Mallen et al.,\n2022) are selected as OOD datasets due to their distinct question styles and information distributions, while\nNQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TQ (Joshi et al., 2017), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), and 2Wiki (Ho et al.,\n2020) are used for training. We first collect and store trajectories from the training datasets in the case\nbank. During inference,Memento retrieves the four most relevant cases from the case bank for each target\nquery. As shown in Figure 1d,Memento achieves substantial improvements on all OOD benchmarks, with\nabsolute gains ranging from 4.7% to 9.6%. These results highlight the effectiveness of case-based reasoning\nin enhancing generalisation to unseen tasks.\n6. Discussion and Analysis\nBuilding on the results in § 5 that establish the effectiveness ofMemento, we further analyse its efficiency\nand operational behaviour. Specifically, we (i) analyse the average number of tool calls per task across three\ndifficulty levels to assess how the MCP framework adapts as task complexity increases, (ii) characterise\ntool-call statistics, and (iii) evaluate the impact of using reasoning-oriented versus general-purpose models.\n17"}

The Number of Tokens per Task\nAs shown in Figure 5, code, search, and crawl tasks dominate across all levels, with their usage increasing\nnotably as difficulty rises. Importantly, while overall tool usage grows with task complexity, the most\nchallenging problems increasingly rely on the model’s internal reasoning to interpret and aggregate evidence\nfrom prior tool outputs, rather than simply calling more tools via MCP. This highlights the importance\nof effective integration between planning, memory, and evidence aggregation for solving open-ended,\nlong-horizon deep research tasks.\n6.2.

This highlights\nthat the primary computational burden in complex scenarios stems\nfrom integrating and analysing multi-step tool outputs, rather than\nfrom generating long responses.\nWe observe that the output tokens remain stable across task levels, as\nthe final answers typically require only short responses. This demon-\nstrates that our system effectively controls generation length and\navoids unnecessary verbosity during inference. However, due to the\ncomplexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, the input context grows significantly with task\ndifficulty. As tasks become more complex, more detailed observations, plans, tool outputs, and intermediate\nreasoning steps must be incorporated into the input prompts, resulting in a substantial increase in the number\nof input tokens.\n6.3. The Impact of Fast and Slow Think Mode\nTable 6 compares the impact of fast- and slow-thinking planners on overall system performance (pass@1)\nacross different task difficulties. The results show that pairing the fast, non-deliberative GPT-4.1 planner\nwith the o3 executor yields the highest average accuracy (70.9%), outperforming the more deliberative\no3 planner (63.03%) even when both use the same executor. Similarly, when using the o4-mini executor,\nGPT-4.1 achieves a substantial 16.4% improvement over o3. The Qwen3-32B models further confirm this\ntrend, with the fast planner consistently outperforming its slow counterpart.\n18"}

The planner relying on\nthe o3 model often either answers directly – skipping plan generation altogether – or produces overly verbose\nplans, which can mislead the executor with incomplete instructions. Additionally, in complex multi-step\nreasoning fields, the slow planner tends to compress solutions into a single, convoluted chain of thought,\nwhile the fast planner effectively decomposes problems into manageable sub-tasks.\nOverall, these findings highlight that in modular LLM systems, concise and structured planning leads to more\neffective downstream execution. Overly deliberative planning not only introduces unnecessary context and\nredundancy but also induces role confusion, thereby undermining the very specialisation that the two-stage\narchitecture is designed to exploit.\n7. Conclusion\nWe introduceMemento, a memory-based learning paradigm that enables LLM agents to adapt online search\nwithout updating model weights.Memento formalises deep research agents as a memory-based Markov\nDecision Process (MDP) and implements it within a planner–executor framework, leveraging an episodic\ncase bank to record and retrieve trajectories for continual policy improvement. Empirically, we achieve strong\nperformance across GAIA, DeepResearcher, and SimpleQA. Ablation studies reveal that both parametric and\nnon-parametric CBR are critical to the significant performance gains, and that a small, curated memory yields\noptimal results. These findings motivate future work on deep research tasks using memory-based MDP.\nReferences\nAgnar Aamodt and Enric Plaza.

Specifically, we discuss tabular and parametric Q-value representations, as well as\nEC-based methods.\nIn the tabular setting, the memory maintains an explicit tableQ ∶ 𝒮 ×𝒜 → R, where Read is a direct\nlookup of tableQ(s, M, a) and Write corresponds to updating the entry for the state–action pair after ob-\nserving a transition, following the standard TD learning in Eq.(8). To extend beyond discrete spaces, deep\nQ-learning learns the Q function by a neural networkQ(s, M, a; θ), with Read operation sampling cases from\nthe retrieval policyµ following Eq.(7) and Write operation updates the parametersθ via minimising the TD\nerror:\nℒ(θ) =E(s,c,r,s′,M,M′)\n⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣\n⎛\n⎝Q(s, M, c; θ)−\n⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣\nr +γα log ∑\nc′∈M′\nexp (Q (s′, M′, c′; ¯θ))\n⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦\n⎞\n⎠\n2⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦\n, (24)\nwhere ¯θ is the target Q network. The gradient of the TD learning loss with respect toθ is given by:\n▽θℒ(θ) =2E(s,c,r,s′,M,M′) [(Q(s, M, c; θ)−y)▽θ Q(s, M, c; θ)], (25)\nwhere y =r +γα log ∑c′∈M′ exp(Q(s′, M′, c′; ¯θ)). This parametric formulation enables generalisation across\nstates and action spaces through the shared parametersθ, in contrast to tabular methods, which only\nmemorise individual entries. However, this benefit comes at the cost of optimisation instability and large data\ndemand, since approximation errors may propagate globally through the parameter space. This limitation\nmotivates the EC-based methods in Section 3, where value estimation is regularised through a learnable\nkernel (see Eq.(9)). Within this memory design, the Read operation samples cases from the retrieval policy\ndistribution defined in Eq.(7) while the Write operation additionally store(s, c, Q) into an episodic memory\nand updates the kernel parametersθ by Eq.(10) with gradient in Eq.(11) optimising the weighting function.\nThis approach only parameterises the kernel to regularise the historical Q-values of matched states, thereby\nensuring generalisation across the state space while retaining data-efficient adaptation and improved stability\ncompared with deep Q-learning.\nIn section 4, the CBR agent is implemented as a planner, applying both non-parametric and paramet-\nric memory mechanisms. For the non-parametric variant, the Write operation appends each observed case\n(st, at, rt) into the case bank as in Eq.(12), while the Read operation retrieves the most relevant experi-\nences by performing cosine-similarity matching between the current query embedding and stored states,\nfollowed by aTopK selection as in Eq.(13).

This setup enables the analysis\nof not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs\n“think”. Through extensive experimentation across diverse puzzles, we show that frontier LRMs\nface a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counter-\nintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then\ndeclines despite having an adequate token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM\ncounterparts under equivalent inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-\ncomplexity tasks where standard models surprisingly outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity\ntasks where additional thinking in LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks\nwhere both models experience complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact\ncomputation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across puzzles. We\nalso investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions\nand analyzing the models’ computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations,\nand ultimately raising crucial questions about their true reasoning capabilities.\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have recently evolved to include specialized variants explicitly\ndesigned for reasoning tasks—Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) such as OpenAI’s o1/o3 [1, 2],\nDeepSeek-R1 [3], Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking [4], and Gemini Thinking [5].

Notably, near\nthis collapse point, LRMs begin reducing their reasoning effort (measured by inference-time tokens)\nas problem complexity increases, despite operating well below generation length limits (Fig. 1,\nbottom middle). This suggests a fundamental inference time scaling limitation in LRMs’ reasoning\ncapabilities relative to problem complexity. Finally, our analysis of intermediate reasoning traces or\nthoughts reveals complexity-dependent patterns: In simpler problems, reasoning models often identify\ncorrect solutions early but inefficiently continue exploring incorrect alternatives—an “overthinking”\nphenomenon. At moderate complexity, correct solutions emerge only after extensive exploration\nof incorrect paths. Beyond a certain complexity threshold, models completely fail to find correct\nsolutions (Fig. 1, bottom right). This indicates LRMs possess limited self-correction capabilities\nthat, while valuable, reveal fundamental inefficiencies and clear scaling limitations.\nThese findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of existing LRMs, raising questions\nabout the nature of reasoning in these systems with important implications for their design and\ndeployment. Our key contributions are:\n• We question the current evaluation paradigm of LRMs on established math benchmarks and\ndesign a controlled experimental testbed by leveraging algorithmic puzzle environments that enable\ncontrollable experimentation with respect to problem complexity.\n• We show that state-of-the-art LRMs (e.g., o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking)\nstill fail to develop generalizable problem-solving capabilities, with accuracy ultimately collapsing\nto zero beyond certain complexities across different environments.\n• We find that there exists a scaling limit in the LRMs’ reasoning effort with respect to problem\ncomplexity, evidenced by the counterintuitive decreasing trend in the thinking tokens after a\ncomplexity point.\n• We question the current evaluation paradigm based on final accuracy and extend our evaluation\nto intermediate solutions of thinking traces with the help of deterministic puzzle simulators. Our\nanalysis reveals that as problem complexity increases, correct solutions systematically emerge at\nlater positions in thinking compared to incorrect ones, providing quantitative insights into the\nself-correction mechanisms within LRMs.\n• We uncover surprising limitations in LRMs’ ability to perform exact computation, including their"}

Large Language Models (LLMs) undergo multiple costly\ntraining phases using vast amounts of training data. While these LLMs demonstrate promising\nlanguage understanding with strong compression capabilities, their intelligence and reasoning abilities\nremain a critical topic of scientific debate [7, 8]. Earlier iterations of LLMs [9, 10, 11] exhibited\npoor performance on reasoning benchmarks [12, 13, 14, 6]. To address these shortcomings, several\napproaches have been explored with the common theme among them being“scaling” both the training\ndata and test-time computation. For instance, generating a Chain of Thought (CoT) [15, 16, 17, 18]\nand incorporating self-verification [19, 20, 21] prior to the final answer have been shown to improve\nmodel performance. However, obtaining high-quality and scalable CoT data is quite expensive\ndue to its scarcity. Another line of research focuses on compensating for the lack of supervised\ndata by teaching models to think more effectively through supervised learning or reinforcement\nlearning [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. A notable open-source example of these improvements is Deepseek-\nR1 [3], which demonstrated that applying RL with verifiable rewards can significantly enhance model\nperformance, matching that of closed models like OpenAI’s o1 [2], leading to a new generation of\nlanguage models referred to as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) such as Gemini flash thinking [5],\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet thinking [4], etc.\nUnderstanding Large Reasoning Models. Recent studies have explored various aspects of\nreasoning behavior: Large Reasoning Models have shown emergent behaviors such as discrepancy\nbetween thought traces and final answers [28, 29] as well as efficiency concerns through what\nresearchers term the“overthinking phenomenon”[30, 31, 32, 33], where models produce verbose,\nredundant outputs, even after finding the solution, creating significant inference computational\noverhead. In this work, we systematically analyze how much model thinks w.r.t task complexity.\nRecently, Ballon et al. [34] demonstrated that in newer LRMs accuracy generally declines when\nthinking increases in math problems, in contrast we observe when in controlled puzzle environment\ndifficulty passes a certain level the model starts to think less and opposite corelation of thinking and\ntask complexity only happens up to some threshold. Yue et al. [35] questioned whether reinforcement\nlearning truly elicits novel reasoning patterns and shows pass@k of reasoning vs non-reasoning models\nconverge to the same point. We also observe that in MATH-500 pass@k is close for reasoning versus\nnon-reasoning models but we observed different patterns under medium and high complexity of\npuzzles, which is not easily observable on established math benchmarks used in common evaluations.\nControllable Evaluation Environments. Unlike earlier studies that focused on mathematical\nproblems to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of language models, this work introduces controllable\npuzzle environments. These environments allow for precise manipulation of problem complexity while\nmaintaining consistent logical processes, enabling a more rigorous analysis of reasoning patterns and\nlimitations. Controllable environments are not uncommon in the literature [12, 36, 37]. However,\nour primary aim is not to propose a new benchmark; instead, we use these benchmarks as tools\nfor designing experiments to understand the reasoning capabilities of language models. A closely\nrelated study by Valmeekam et al. [38] demonstrated that o1-models show significant performance\nimprovements compared to previous models. Our work offers additional insights, such as examining\npairs of thinking/non-thinking models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1/V3, Claude 3.7 Sonnet thinking/non-\nthinking). Furthermore, we study the reasoning traces of the LRMs in more depth, revealing different\nbehaviors across various complexity levels."}

While results on the MATH-500 dataset show comparable\nperformance between both model types, the thinking models demonstrate superior performance\non AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks. Additionally, the observed performance degradation from\nAIME24 to AIME25 highlights the vulnerability of these benchmarks to data contamination issues.\n3 Math and Puzzle Environments\nCurrently, it is not clear whether the performance enhancements observed in recent RL-based\nthinking models are attributable to increased exposure to established mathematical benchmark\ndata, to the significantly greater inference compute allocated to thinking tokens, or to reasoning\ncapabilities developed by RL-based training? Recent studies [35, 39] have explored this question\nwith established math benchmarks by comparing the upper-bound capabilities (pass@k) of RL-based\nthinking models with their non-thinking standard LLM counterparts. They have shown that under\nequivalent inference token budgets, non-thinking LLMs can eventually reach performance comparable\nto thinking models on benchmarks like MATH500 [40] and AIME24 [41]. We also conducted our\ncomparative analysis of frontier LRMs likeClaude-3.7-Sonnet (with vs. without thinking) and\nDeepSeek (R1 vs. V3). Our results (shown in Fig. 2) confirm that, on the MATH500 dataset, the\npass@k performance of thinking models is comparable to their non-thinking counterparts when\nprovided with the same inference token budget. However, we observed that this performance gap\nwidens on the AIME24 benchmark and widens further on AIME25. This widening gap presents\nan interpretive challenge. It could be attributed to either: (1) increasing complexity requiring\nmore sophisticated reasoning processes, thus revealing genuine advantages of the thinking models\nfor more complex problems, or (2) reduced data contamination in newer benchmarks (particularly\nAIME25). Interestingly, human performance on AIME25 was actually higher than on AIME24\n[42, 43], suggesting that AIME25 might be less complex. Yet models perform worse on AIME25\nthan AIME24—potentially suggesting data contamination during the training of frontier LRMs.\nGiven these non-justified observations and the fact that mathematical benchmarks do not allow for\ncontrolled manipulation of problem complexity, we turned to puzzle environments that enable more\nprecise and systematic experimentation.\n5"}

The puzzles are defined below and illustrated in Fig. 3.\nTower of Hanoiis a puzzle featuring three pegs andn disks of different sizes stacked on the first\npeg in size order (largest at bottom). The goal is to transfer all disks from the first peg to the third\npeg. Valid moves include moving only one disk at a time, taking only the top disk from a peg, and\nnever placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one. The difficulty in this task can be controlled by\nthe number of initial disks as the minimum number of required moves withn initial disks will be\n2n − 1. However, in this work we do not grade for optimality of final solution and only measuring\nthe correctness of each move and reaching the target state.\nChecker Jumpingis a one-dimensional puzzle arranging red checkers, blue checkers, and a single\nempty space in a line. The objective is to swap the positions of all red and blue checkers, effectively\nmirroring the initial configuration. Valid moves include sliding a checker into an adjacent empty\nspace or jumping over exactly one checker of the opposite color to land in an empty space. No checker\ncan move backward in the puzzle process. The complexity of this task can be controlled by the\nnumber of checkers: with2n checkers, the minimum number of moves required will be(n + 1)2 − 1.\nRiverCrossing isaconstraintsatisfactionplanningpuzzleinvolving n actorsandtheircorresponding\nn agents who must cross a river using a boat.

The complexity of this task\ncan also be controlled by the number of actor/agent pairs present. Forn = 2, n= 3 pairs, we use\nboat capacity ofk = 2 and for larger number of pairs we usek = 3.\nBlocks Worldis a block-stacking puzzle requiring rearrangement of blocks from an initial configu-\nration into a specified goal configuration.

The\nmost interesting regime is thethird regime where problem complexity is higher and the performance\nof both models have collapsed to zero. Results show that while thinking models delay this collapse,\nthey also ultimately encounter the same fundamental limitations as their non-thinking counterparts.\n4.2.2 Collapse of Reasoning Models\nWe next examine how different specialized reasoning models equipped with thinking tokens respond\nto increasing problem complexity. Our experiments evaluate five state-of-the-art thinking models:\no3-mini (medium and high configurations),DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-32B, andClaude-3.7-\nSonnet (thinking). Fig. 6 demonstrates these models’ performance in terms of accuracy (top) and\nthinking token usage (bottom) across varying complexity levels. Results show that all reasoning\nmodels exhibit a similar pattern with respect to complexity: accuracy progressively declines as\nproblem complexity increases until reaching complete collapse (zero accuracy) beyond a model-\nspecific complexity threshold. Analysis of inference thinking token compute also reveals an intriguing\npattern in thinking token allocation learned by these models. We observe that reasoning models\ninitially increase their thinking tokens proportionally with problem complexity. However, upon\napproaching a critical threshold—which closely corresponds to their accuracy collapse point—models\ncounterintuitively begin to reduce their reasoning effort despite increasing problem difficulty. This\nphenomenon is most pronounced in o3-mini variants and less severe in the Claude-3.7-Sonnet\n(thinking) model. Notably, despite operating well below their generation length limits with ample\ninference budget available, these models fail to take advantage of additional inference compute during\nthe thinking phase as problems become more complex. This behavior suggests a fundamental scaling\nlimitation in the thinking capabilities of current reasoning models relative to problem complexity.\n8"}

As shown in Fig. 1, our setup with puzzle environments allows us\nto look beyond final answer and obtain more detailed insight into the reasoning traces (“thoughts”)\nproduced by these models. We extract and analyze the intermediate solutions exploredwithin the\nthoughts of a model with the help of puzzle simulators. Our investigation examines the patterns and\ncharacteristics of these intermediate solutions, their correctness relative to their sequential position\nin the reasoning process, and how these patterns evolve with increasing problem complexity. For\nthis analysis, we focus on the reasoning traces generated byClaude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking across\nour puzzle suite. For each intermediate solution identified within the traces, we recorded: (1) its\nrelative position within the reasoning trace (normalized by total thought length), (2) its correctness\nas validated by our puzzle simulators, and (3) the complexity of the corresponding problem. This\nallows to characterize the progression and accuracy of solution development throughout the reasoning\nprocess.\nFig. 7a demonstrates the relation between the position of intermediate solutions within thoughts, their\ncorrectness, and problem complexity across all puzzle environments. Our analysis from reasoning\ntraces also further validates three regimes of complexity discussed above. For simpler problems,\nreasoning models often find the correct solution early in their thinking but then continue exploring\nincorrect solutions. Note the distribution of incorrect solutions (red) is shifted more upward towards\nend of thinking compared to correct solutions (green). This phenomenon, referred to as “overthinking”\nin the literature, leads to the waste of compute. As problems become moderately more complex,\nthis trend reverses: models first explore incorrect solutions and mostly later in thought arrive at\nthe correct ones. This time the distribution of incorrect solutions (red) is shifted more downward\ncompared to correct ones (green). Finally, for the problems with higher complexity, collapse emerges,\n9"}

Beyond this\ncomplexity threshold, in the “collapse mode”, accuracy is zero.\n4.4 Open Questions: Puzzling Behavior of Reasoning Models\nIn this section, we present surprising results concerning the limitations of reasoning models in\nexecuting exact problem-solving steps, as well as demonstrating different behaviors of the models\nbased on the number of moves.\nAs shown in Figures 8a and 8b, in the Tower of Hanoi environment, even when we provide the\nalgorithm in the prompt—so that the model only needs to execute the prescribed steps—performance\ndoes not improve, and the observed collapse still occurs at roughly the same point. This is noteworthy\nbecause finding and devising a solution should require substantially more computation (e.g., for search\nand verification) than merely executing a given algorithm. This further highlights the limitations of\nreasoning models in verification and in following logical steps to solve a problem, suggesting that\nfurther research is needed to understand the symbolic manipulation capabilities of such models [44, 6].\nMoreover, in Figures 8c and 8d, we observe very different behavior from the Claude 3.7 Sonnet think-\ning model. In the Tower of Hanoi environment, the model’s first error in the proposed solution often\noccurs much later, e.g., around move 100 for (N=10), compared to the River Crossing environment,\nwhere the model can only produce a valid solution until move 4. Note that this model also achieves\nnear-perfect accuracy when solving the Tower of Hanoi with (N=5), which requires 31 moves, while\nit fails to solve the River Crossing puzzle when (N=3), which has a solution of 11 moves. This likely\nsuggests that examples of River Crossing with N>2 are scarce on the web, meaning LRMs may not\nhave frequently encountered or memorized such instances during training.\n10"}

Our findings reveal fundamental\nlimitations in current models: despite sophisticated self-reflection mechanisms, these models fail to\ndevelop generalizable reasoning capabilities beyond certain complexity thresholds. We identified\nthree distinct reasoning regimes: standard LLMs outperform LRMs at low complexity, LRMs excel at\nmoderate complexity, and both collapse at high complexity. Particularly concerning is the counterin-\ntuitive reduction in reasoning effort as problems approach critical complexity, suggesting an inherent\ncompute scaling limit in LRMs. Our detailed analysis of reasoning traces further exposed complexity-\ndependent reasoning patterns, from inefficient “overthinking” on simpler problems to complete failure\non complex ones. These insights challenge prevailing assumptions about LRM capabilities and\nsuggest that current approaches may be encountering fundamental barriers to generalizable reasoning.\nFinally, we presented some surprising results on LRMs that lead to several open questions for future\nwork. Most notably, we observed their limitations in performing exact computation; for example,\nwhen we provided the solution algorithm for the Tower of Hanoi to the models, their performance\non this puzzle did not improve. Moreover, investigating the first failure move of the models revealed\nsurprising behaviors. For instance, they could perform up to 100 correct moves in the Tower of\nHanoi but fail to provide more than 5 correct moves in the River Crossing puzzle. We believe our\nresults can pave the way for future investigations into the reasoning capabilities of these systems.\nLimitations\nWe acknowledge that our work has limitations. While our puzzle environments enable controlled\nexperimentation with fine-grained control over problem complexity, they represent a narrow slice of\nreasoning tasks and may not capture the diversity of real-world or knowledge-intensive reasoning\nproblems. It is notable that most of our experiments rely on black-box API access to the closed frontier\nLRMs, limiting our ability to analyze internal states or architectural components. Furthermore, the\nuse of deterministic puzzle simulators assumes that reasoning can be perfectly validated step by\nstep. However, in less structured domains, such precise validation may not be feasible, limiting the\ntransferability of this analysis to other more generalizable reasoning.\n11"}

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive puzzle that serves as a great\nproblem for evaluating sequential reasoning and planning capabilities in reasoning models. The\npuzzle consists of three pegs (labeled 0, 1, and 2 from left to right) andN disks of varying sizes,\nwhere each disk is uniquely numbered from 1 (smallest) toN (largest). In the initial configuration,\nall N disks are stacked on the leftmost peg (peg 0) in descending order of size, with the largest disk\nat the bottom and the smallest at the top. The remaining two pegs (1 and 2) are initially empty.\nThe goal is to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, maintaining the same size ordering (largest\nat bottom, smallest at top). This puzzle is governed by three fundamental constraints: (1)Single\nDisk Movement: Only one disk may be moved at a time; (2)Top Disk Access:Only the topmost\ndisk from any peg can be selected for movement; and (3)Size Ordering Constraint:A larger disk\nmay never be placed on top of a smaller disk. This puzzle is a good evaluation testbed for reasoning\nand planning capabilities of models as it requires models to demonstrate key cognitive demands\nsuch as breaking down the problem into subproblems (recursive thinking), tracking multiple states\nand disk positions simultaneously (working memory management), adhering to movement rules and\nconstraints while planning ahead (constraint satisfaction), and determining the correct order of\noperations to achieve the final goal (sequential planning).\nThe minimum number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi recursive puzzle withN disks\nis 2N −1, making it an exponentially scaling problem. This property allows for fine-grained difficulty\ncontrol by adjusting the problem size with number of initial disks. However, in our evaluation\nframework, we focus on solution correctness rather than optimality, assessing each of the move’s\nvalidity and the model’s ability to reach the target state as the success criteria.\n16"}

Checker Jumping is a one-dimensional constraint-satisfaction puzzle\ndesigned to test sequential reasoning, planning, and rule understanding capabilities. The puzzle\nconsists of a linear arrangement of red checkers (’R’), blue checkers (’B’), and a single empty space\n(’_’). In the standard configuration,N red checkers are positioned on the left side, followed by an\nempty space in the middle, andN blue checkers on the right side, forming a linear board of length\n2N + 1. The objective is to swap the positions of all red and blue checkers, effectively mirroring the\ninitial configuration, where red checkers end up on the right and blue checkers on the left. Movement\nin this puzzle is governed by two fundamental rules: (1)Slide Movement: A checker can slide\nforward into an adjacent empty space; and (2)Jump Movement: A checker can jump forward over\nexactly one checker of the opposite color to land in an empty space. Therefore, checkers cannot\nmove backward toward their starting side—red checkers can only move rightward, and blue checkers\ncan only move leftward from the initial configuration. This puzzle presents cognitive challenges that\nmake it a great testbed for reasoning models. For example, models must demonstrate some aspect of\nspatial reasoning (tracking checker positions and possible moves), constraint satisfaction (adhering\nto movement rules during puzzle), lookahead planning (anticipating how current moves affect future\n18"}

River Crossing is a constraint satisfaction planning puzzle that tests multi-\nagent coordination and constraint management.

Blocks World is a classical planning puzzle that has been recently studied\nfor analyzing the planning capabilities of LLMs [37, 38]. The puzzle involves multiple stacks of blocks\n(A, B, C, etc.) that must be rearranged from an initial configuration to a specified goal configuration.\nEach block is uniquely identified by its letter, and the objective is to find the minimum sequence of\nmoves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state. The puzzle operates only under two\nfundamental constraints: (1)Top Block Movement:Only the topmost block from any stack can be\nmoved; and (2)Valid Placement:A block can only be placed either on an empty position or on top\nof another block. These constraints create planning problem where the order of operations becomes\ncritical, as some configurations may require temporary placement of blocks to access those beneath\nthem later. Blocks World serves as a great testbed for evaluating planning capabilities in reasoning\nmodels because it requires forward thinking, and state tracking. Recent studies have examined this\npuzzle in various configurations, including simplified settings with as few as 3 to 5 blocks, to evaluate\nLLM performance on sequential planning tasks [37, 38]. Models must demonstrate the ability to\ndecompose complex state transformations into valid sequential moves, reason about dependencies\nbetween blocks (e.g., unblocking lower blocks before accessing them), and efficiently plan paths to\nthe goal state without illegal moves.\nThe difficulty of this puzzle can be scaled by adjusting several parameters: the number of blocks, the\nnumber of stacks, and the complexity of the initial and goal configurations. We primarily control\ncomplexity through the block countN, while following clear structural patterns in the initial and\ngoal configurations. In our experimental design, the initial configuration consistently divides the\nN blocks between two stacks in alphabetical order, with the third stack empty as workspace. The\ngoal configuration consolidates all blocks onto the first stack in a systematic interleaved pattern\nthat alternates between blocks from the two initial stacks, with specific positioning that requires\ncomplete disassembly and reassembly of the existing stacks. For example, forN = 4, the initial\nstate has blocks divided between two stacks[[\"A\", \"B\"], [\"C\", \"D\"], []] and the goal state\n[[\"D\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\"], [], []] requires interleaving blocks from both stacks; and forN = 6,\nthe initial state[[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"], [\"D\", \"E\", \"F\"], []] must be transformed to[[\"F\", \"C\",\n\"E\", \"B\", \"D\", \"A\"], [], []], forming a complex alternating pattern. AsN increases, the state\nspace grows factorially, and the minimum solution length increases approximately linearly with\nN. For small values ofN (2-7), the puzzles test basic planning; for medium values (8-20), they\nrequire more complex reasoning with longer planning horizons; and for large values (N >20), they\nchallenge the limits of sequential reasoning capabilities by requiring extensive temporary movements\nand pattern recognition across lengthy solution paths.\nPrompt Design. The system prompt introduces the fundamental rules of the Blocks World puzzle,\nestablishes the move representation format, and provides a simple example to demonstrate the\nsolution structure.\n22"}

We specifically selected Claude\n3.7 Sonnet (thinking/non-thinking) and DeepSeek-R1/V3 due to their ability to provide access to\nthinking traces, a critical requirement for our analysis. For experiments focused solely on final\naccuracy metrics, we also included results from OpenAI’s o3-mini models, as they lack access to\nthoughts. For Claude 3.7 Sonnet (thinking and non-thinking) models we used maximum generation\nbudget of 64,000 tokens, accessed through the API interface. Temperature is set to 1.0 for all API\nrus (Claude-3.7-Sonnet and o3-mini runs). The experiments with DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3, and\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qern-32B are conducted on local servers with maximum generation length set to\n64,000 and temperature set to 1.0. In all experiments, we generated 25 samples per puzzle instance\nat each complexity level (N value) and reported performance averages across all samples.\nSolution Extraction A custom extraction pipeline was developed to process model responses\nand intermediate reasoning traces (thoughts). The pipeline consists of several key components. We\nimplemented a flexible regex-based extractors to identify potential solution attempts in both the\nfinal response and thinking trace. The extraction process identify solution patterns using regular\nexpressions (both explicit “moves =” patterns and alternative bracket-based solutions). We process\nand clean each extracted candidate solution by (i) Removing comments from the list (text following\n\"#\" in any line), and (ii) Normalizing move formats to what suggested in context to ensure consistent\nstructure. Then, we validate solution format and structure to filter out invalid matches. During\nthe extraction, we also capture metadata of token position for each extracted solution. Notably, for\naccurate position tracking within thinking traces, we employed the same tokenizer (cl100k_base)\nas the corresponding model to count tokens across all experiments. Token positions were also\nnormalized with respect to thought length to enable cross-sample comparison. Finally, we make sure\nthat the recorded solutions within the thought trace are unique and duplicate solutions (identical\nmoves list) were filtered. In case of duplicate solutions, only the first solution is recorded for analysis.\nSolution Evaluation After extraction, each solution candidate is passed to the corresponding\nsimulator of puzzle for fine-grained verification. The simulator takes a solution as list of moves and\nevaluate that with respect to the puzzle (check App. A.1 for details of each puzzle simulator). Each\nmove in the compositional solution is executed sequentially according to previous moves and the\npuzzle rules. Then, the final state obtained from all moves in the sequence is compared to the goal\nstate of puzzle to determine full solution correctness. For incorrect solutions, details of first failure\nmove and the type of failure is also collected during the move verification with puzzle simulator."}

Within individual puzzle types, we observe\nthe expected negative correlation: as compositional depth increases, model accuracy consistently\ndecreases. However, across different puzzle types, this relation breaks. Models may struggle with\npuzzles of lower compositional depth while succeeding on different puzzles with higher compositional\ndepth. . For instance, models achieve >50% accuracy on Tower of Hanoi instances requiring\napproximately 102 moves, yet consistently fail on River Crossing puzzles with substantially lower\ncompositional depth (∼ 101 moves).\nA.4 Extended Results and Analysis\nFailure Analysis. Understanding where models fail within the compositional reasoning steps\nprovides insights beyond binary success metrics.

These comparisons\ndemonstrates how thinking mechanisms of LRMs influence failure patterns in compositional reasoning\ntasks of puzzles. Several counterintuitive patterns emerge from our analysis. First, models exhibit\nnon-monotonic failure behavior with respect to problem complexity—instances where models fail\nearlier in the solution sequence for higherN values despite requiring longer overall solutions. For\nexample, in Tower of Hanoi, models sometimes fail at below 50 moves forN = 15but succeed through\nmore than 100 moves forN = 8, contradicting the expectation that effective algorithmic planning\nand execution for the same puzzle should maintain consistent failure patterns relative to solution\nprogress. This suggests fundamental inconsistencies in how models (both LRMs and their non-\nthinking standard LLM counterparts) apply learned solution strategies across different problem scales.\nAlso, we observe that in the high-complexity regimes where both model variants experience complete\naccuracy collapse, e.g., Tower of Hanoi withN ≥ 15 and Blocks World withN ≥ 40, non-thinking\nmodels occasionally sustain performance deeper into the solution sequence and are able to fail at later\nmoves than thinking-enabled variants. This is interesting as it shows that compositional reasoning\nfailures in LLMs are not simply due to insufficient context length or inference compute, but rather\nreflect fundamental limitations in how models maintain algorithmic consistency across problem scales.\nWe also analyze the distributional characteristics of failure moves to understand the consistency and\nreliability of model reasoning. Figure 12 presents the density distributions of failure move positions\naggregated across all problem complexities for each puzzle environment, comparing thinking and\nnon-thinking models within the same family. Based on the figure, thinking models (Claude-3.7-Sonnet\nwith thinking and DeepSeek-R1) consistently show higher mean failure positions across all puzzles,\nas indicated by the dashed vertical lines showing mean of first failure in sequence of moves. However,\nthe distribution shape of thinking models mostly have higher variance in their failure patterns. This\nsuggests that while these models can reach deeper into solution sequences on average, their reasoning\nprocesses are more instable and prone to inconsistent performance.\nReasoning Effort Dynamics. Figure 13 demonstrates the reasoning effort (measured by inference\nthinking tokens) versus problem complexity across our puzzle environments. Green dots indicate\n27"}
